# üß† FlowMind Context Index

**The Complete Guide to AI-Native Framework Orchestration**

Welcome to the FlowMind context ecosystem - where LLMs embody frameworks through context switching to solve complex problems with unprecedented intelligence.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Claude Code Adapter Users
If you're using Claude Code, you can leverage these contexts directly:

```bash
# Navigate to the contexts directory
cd contexts/

# Browse available patterns
ls patterns/

# Use any pattern by referencing it in your work
# The FlowMind system will handle context switching and orchestration
```

### üöÄ **The Ultimate Power Combo**
For maximum intelligence orchestration:

1. **Scan & Analyze:** Use each relevant context to analyze your situation
2. **Save Analysis:** Store insights in `{pwd}/tmp/*.md` using extended reasoning
3. **Synthesize:** Apply all patterns/workflows/agents to the challenge
4. **Breakthrough:** Generate final synthesis and share emergent insights

## üîÆ **Advanced Features**

### Semantic Triggering
Many contexts support semantic conditions like:
```yaml
when_semantic: "user seems frustrated"
when_semantic: "complex technical challenge"
when_semantic: "need strategic framework"
```

### Context Integration
Contexts can automatically trigger other contexts:
```yaml
integration:
  complements: ["systems-thinking", "first-principles-thinking"]
  follows_well: ["problem-definition"]
  leads_to: ["solution-implementation"]
```

### Dynamic Orchestration
The system supports:
- Multi-context workflows with context switching
- Semantic routing based on problem analysis
- Automatic framework combination suggestions
- Outcome-based optimization

## üìö **How to Use This System**

### 1. **Single Framework Application**
```bash
# Apply specific pattern to your problem
contexts/patterns/porter-five-forces/
# Use template: contexts/patterns/porter-five-forces/templates/analysis-template.md
```

### 2. **Workflow Orchestration**
```bash
# Run multi-step process
contexts/workflows/design-thinking-process/
# Follows: Empathize ‚Üí Define ‚Üí Ideate ‚Üí Prototype ‚Üí Test
```

### 3. **Agent Consultation**
```bash
# Get specialized perspective
contexts/agents/eeps/ntj-strategist/
# Embody strategic thinking personality
```

### 4. **Power Combo Sequences**
```bash
# Chain multiple frameworks for complex problems
1. contexts/patterns/systems-thinking/ (understand the system)
2. contexts/patterns/first-principles-thinking/ (break to fundamentals)  
3. contexts/patterns/blue-ocean-strategy/ (create new solutions)
4. contexts/workflows/lean-startup-cycle/ (validate and iterate)
```

## üéØ **Best Practices**

### For Simple Problems
Start with a single pattern that matches your domain:
- Business decision ‚Üí `decision-matrix`
- Innovation challenge ‚Üí `scamper-framework`
- Technical architecture ‚Üí `first-principles-thinking`

### For Complex Problems
Use the **Intelligence Orchestration Approach**:
1. **Analyze** with `systems-thinking`
2. **Deconstruct** with `first-principles-thinking`
3. **Innovate** with domain-specific frameworks
4. **Validate** with `lean-startup` principles
5. **Synthesize** insights across all frameworks

### For Strategic Initiatives
Follow the **Strategic Intelligence Stack**:
1. **Environment Analysis:** `porter-five-forces`
2. **Internal Assessment:** `swot-analysis`
3. **Innovation Opportunity:** `blue-ocean-strategy`
4. **Business Model:** `business-model-canvas`
5. **Implementation:** `lean-startup-cycle`
