  replication_instructions: |
    FOR any complex topic requiring comprehensive analysis:
    
    1. DISCOVERY:
       - Scan ~/c directory for all available contexts
       - Count total contexts and categorize by type
       - Create tmp/ directory for analysis outputs
       
    2. PARALLEL ANALYSIS:
       - Process 5-10 most relevant contexts in batches
       - Apply each context framework to target topic
       - Save individual analysis to tmp/{context-name}.md
       - Focus on unique perspective each context provides
       
    3. SYNTHESIS:
       - Load all tmp/*.md files
       - Apply document-synthesis workflow
       - Identify patterns, convergence, and conflicts
       - Create unified insights document
       
    4. PARLIAMENT:
       - Apply cognitive-parliament workflow to synthesis
       - Generate 8-personality analysis
       - Resolve conflicts and build consensus
       - Create final decision with authorization level
       
    5. CAPTURE:
       - Document successful pattern as power combo
       - Include performance metrics and lessons learned
       - Save replication guide for future use
