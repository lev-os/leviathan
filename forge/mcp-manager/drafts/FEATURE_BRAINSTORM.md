# ðŸ’­ Environment Manager Feature Brainstorm

## ðŸ”¥ Features That Came Up

### Auto-Rotation (The "Crazy" One)
```bash
kingly rotate OPENAI_API_KEY --staged
# 1. Test new key in staging project
# 2. Gradually roll out to production projects  
# 3. Monitor for failures, rollback if needed
# 4. Complete rotation across entire workspace
```

**Why it's powerful**: Security compliance becomes effortless
**Why it's crazy**: Maybe too complex for MVP?

### Environment Variable Patterns
- Detect common patterns (DATABASE_URL vs DB_URL)
- Suggest standardization across projects
- Auto-generate missing variables based on patterns

### Security Intelligence  
- Scan for keys accidentally committed to git
- Detect weak/default passwords
- Check for keys with excessive permissions
- Suggest least-privilege alternatives

### Project Templates with Environment
```bash
kingly create react-app --with-env=ai-development
# Creates new React project
# Pre-configured with AI development .env template
# MCP servers already set up
# Ready to code immediately
```

### Workspace Analytics
- Which keys are most used?
- Which projects share dependencies?
- Cost analysis (API usage across projects)
- Security score for entire workspace

## ðŸŽ¯ MVP vs Future Features

**MVP (Phase 1)**:
- Environment discovery and consolidation
- Basic MCP server deployment  
- Simple key management

**Future (Phase 2+)**:
- Auto-rotation and staged deployments
- Advanced security features
- Analytics and insights
