Feature: AI Orchestration of MCP Servers
  As a developer
  I want the AI to coordinate multiple MCP servers intelligently
  So that they work together seamlessly without conflicts

  Scenario: Multi-server workflows
    Given I have git, filesystem, and browser MCP servers installed
    When I say "create a new feature branch and open the PR template"
    Then it should coordinate between servers:
      | Server | Action |
      | git | Create feature branch |
      | filesystem | Copy PR template |
      | browser | Open GitHub PR page |
    And all actions should complete in the correct order

  Scenario: Intelligent error recovery
    Given a file operation fails due to permissions
    When the filesystem MCP server returns an error
    Then the AI should understand the error context
    And it should suggest fixes (chmod, sudo, etc.)
    And it should ask permission to apply fixes
    And it should retry the operation automatically

  Scenario: Cross-server data sharing
    Given I'm analyzing code with the git MCP server
    When I want to refactor based on the analysis
    Then it should pass relevant data to the filesystem server
    And the filesystem server should receive structured context
    And the refactoring should be informed by git history
    And changes should be properly committed

  Scenario: Performance optimization
    Given multiple MCP servers are running
    When I perform common workflows
    Then the AI should optimize server usage
    And it should cache results across servers
    And it should predict next actions to pre-load data
    And it should manage server resources efficiently

  Scenario: Learning user preferences
    Given I use MCP servers regularly
    When the AI observes my patterns
    Then it should learn my preferred workflows
    And it should suggest optimizations
    And it should adapt server configurations
    And it should become faster over time
