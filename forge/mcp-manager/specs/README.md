# ðŸ”¥ Kingly MCP Manager - BDD Specifications

## The Vision
Transform MCP server management from developer hell to pure magic through AI orchestration.

## Core Features Specified

### 1. Server Discovery (`01-server-discovery.feature`)
- AI finds relevant MCP servers based on project context
- Explains reasoning and confidence scores
- Respects constraints (budget, privacy, etc.)

### 2. Key Management (`02-key-management.feature`) 
- Secure, encrypted storage of API keys
- Automatic key reuse and rotation
- Project-specific key isolation
- Security auditing

### 3. Intelligent Installation (`03-intelligent-installation.feature`)
- One-command environment setup
- Dependency resolution and conflict handling
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Automatic rollback on failures

### 4. Zero-Config Experience (`04-zero-config-experience.feature`)
- 60-second full development environment
- Intent-based setup ("setup for AI-powered React apps")
- Learning from usage patterns
- Context-aware smart defaults

### 5. AI Orchestration (`05-ai-orchestration.feature`)
- Multi-server workflows coordination
- Intelligent error recovery
- Cross-server data sharing
- Performance optimization and learning

## The Demo That Changes Everything

```gherkin
Given I have a fresh Raspberry Pi
When I run "kingly bootstrap web-dev"  
Then within 60 seconds I should have a complete AI development environment
And I should be able to start coding immediately
```

## Success Metrics

- **Setup Time**: Fresh machine â†’ Full dev environment in < 60 seconds
- **Zero Manual Config**: No editing JSON files or managing keys manually
- **Error Recovery**: AI handles 90%+ of common setup issues automatically
- **Learning**: Each use makes the system smarter and faster
