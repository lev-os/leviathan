# Architecture Overview

## The Linux of AI: Working Research Platform

Leviathan represents a fundamental breakthrough in AI system architecture—a working research platform demonstrating the shift from monolithic, proprietary solutions to modular, composable AI systems. Like Linux democratized computing infrastructure, Leviathan is pioneering the democratization of AI intelligence infrastructure through real, working systems.

## Core Philosophy

### LLM-First Design
- **Question**: "Can an LLM do this?" before writing code
- **Context-Driven**: Prompts and context over traditional programming
- **Intelligence Routing**: Confidence-based task delegation

### Memory-Guided Decisions
- **Unified Memory**: Cross-system knowledge integration
- **Temporal Awareness**: Learning from past experiences
- **Context Preservation**: Session continuity across interactions

### Protocol-Based Communication
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Universal AI communication standard
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Seamless system integration
- **Tool Orchestration**: Coordinated multi-system operations
