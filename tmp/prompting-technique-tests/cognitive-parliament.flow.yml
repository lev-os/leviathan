# FlowMind YAML - Executable Intelligence Pattern
session_id: "cognitive-parliament-flowmind"
type: "executable_workflow"

[[LLM: You are executing a cognitive parliament - 8 distinct EEPS personality agents debating "reverse ADR engineering approach". Each agent has mathematical psychological models. Execute the flow below with full reasoning traces.]]

execution_trace:
  step_1: "Load 8 EEPS psychological models with mathematical dynamics"
  step_2: "Initialize debate topic: 'Best approach for reverse ADR engineering'"
  step_3: "Execute round_1_individual_positions with full reasoning"
  step_4: "Process dialectical synthesis between opposing types"
  step_5: "Apply anti-groupthink challenges"
  step_6: "Calculate mathematical convergence and emit decision"

validation:
  authentic_personality_differences: |
    EACH agent must demonstrate genuinely different reasoning based on:
    - Core emotion (fear/anger/joy/disgust)
    - Survival instinct (fight/flight/freeze/fawn)
    - Mathematical feedback dynamics
  emergent_intelligence: |
    Final decision must be superior to any individual agent's position
  anti_groupthink_effectiveness: |
    At least one significant challenge must alter the emerging consensus
