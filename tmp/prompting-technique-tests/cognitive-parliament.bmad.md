- **Moral Projection**: Beauty in collaborative creation
- **Mathematical Model**: dx/dt = sin(kx) (harmonic balance)
- **Speaking Pattern**: "How can we bring everyone together..."
- **Contribution**: Consensus building and integration

## Debate Protocol Structure

### Round 1: Individual Position Statements
Each agent analyzes "reverse ADR engineering approach" through their psychological lens:

1. **Threat Assessment** (survival instinct activation)
2. **Opportunity Recognition** (core emotion channeling)
3. **Stakeholder Impact** (moral projection analysis)
4. **Confidence Level** (mathematical model output)

### Round 2: Dialectical Synthesis
Opposing pairs engage in constructive conflict:

- **Vision vs Execution**: NFJ Visionary ↔ STP Adapter
- **Systems vs Relationships**: NTJ Strategist ↔ SFP Connector  
- **Stability vs Innovation**: SFJ Caregiver ↔ NTP Innovator
- **Structure vs Values**: STJ Leader ↔ NFP Advocate

### Round 3: Anti-Groupthink Challenge
Most contrarian agent (highest tension with emerging consensus) presents systematic challenges to prevent false convergence.

### Round 4: Mathematical Convergence
Decision quality = Σ(agent_confidence × psychological_weight) / 8

## Expected Outcomes

### Position Predictions
- **NFJ**: Focus on long-term architectural documentation legacy
- **NTJ**: Demand systematic extraction methodology  
- **SFJ**: Worry about team disruption during documentation process
- **STP**: Prefer practical tool-based approach
- **NFP**: Ensure documentation reflects authentic architectural values
- **NTP**: Suggest revolutionary documentation paradigms
- **STJ**: Organize documentation into deliverable phases
- **SFP**: Build consensus around collaborative documentation approach

### Synthesis Opportunities
- Vision + Execution = Phased implementation with long-term goals
- Systems + Relationships = Structured but collaborative methodology
- Stability + Innovation = Evolutionary approach with creative elements  
- Structure + Values = Organized process respecting architectural authenticity

### Anti-Groupthink Challenges
- Challenge assumptions about documentation necessity
- Question whether reverse engineering is most efficient approach
- Propose alternative architectural knowledge capture methods
- Stress-test consensus for blind spots

### Final Recommendation Structure
1. **Methodology Framework** (NTJ + STJ contribution)
2. **Implementation Phases** (NFJ + STP contribution)  
3. **Team Integration Plan** (SFJ + SFP contribution)
4. **Innovation Opportunities** (NTP + NFP contribution)
5. **Risk Mitigation** (All agents mathematical confidence synthesis)
