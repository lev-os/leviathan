# Kingly Kingdom Setup | ðŸ”„ Working

## Progress
[ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ] 60% | Monorepo structure created

## Completed âœ…
- T3 Turbo base installed at `aiforge/kingly`
- Research moved to `research/papers/`
- Universal Preview Platform moved to `apps/universal-preview/`
- Created `@kingly/protocol` package with Kernel MCP types
- Set up `kernel-mcp` app structure (Go-based)
- Updated README with Kingly vision

## Structure Created
```
kingly/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ kernel-mcp/        âœ… OS kernel (Go)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ universal-preview/ âœ… Test platform
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ www/              ðŸ”„ kinglyagency.com
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [existing T3 apps]
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ @kingly/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ protocol/     âœ… Kernel MCP protocol
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ai-core/      ðŸ”„ LLM integration
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ memory/       ðŸ”„ A-Mem implementation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [existing packages]
â””â”€â”€ research/             âœ… 40+ papers moved
```

## Next Steps
- [ ] Install dependencies: `cd kingly && pnpm install`
- [ ] Set up private NPM registry for @kingly packages
- [ ] Create ai-core package with TinyLlama integration
- [ ] Move early kingly-os prototype code
- [ ] Configure GitHub packages for private publishing

## Integration Points Ready
- All MCP servers can use `@kingly/protocol`
- Universal Preview can test kernel-mcp
- Agent can detect and use Kingly OS features

## Memory/Decisions
- Using T3 Turbo for modern monorepo management
- Go for kernel-mcp (as decided in research)
- TypeScript for packages (better DX)
- Keeping existing T3 structure for compatibility
