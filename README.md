# Leviathan 🌊

**Status**: 🚧 Research in Progress → Working toward v1.0

A research project exploring AI-native operating systems through cognitive dataflow orchestration, bi-directional intelligence, and emergent workflow systems.

> "Context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step." — **Andrej Karpathy**

## 🧠 Vision

Leviathan represents a paradigm shift toward AI-native computing where **LLMs are the runtime** - the system itself becomes intelligent through cognitive dataflow orchestration, bi-directional communication, and emergent pattern discovery.

## 📊 Current Implementation

### Core Systems

- **MCP Protocol Server** - LLM communication and command execution
- **Session Management** - Checkpoint-based state persistence
- **Command Registry** - Dynamic command discovery and execution
- **Context Discovery** - Semantic search across workflow patterns
- **Universal Router** - CLI and natural language processing

### Active Research Areas

- **Cognitive Dataflow Orchestration** - Graph-based thought processing
- **JEPA 2 Integration** - Temporal reasoning and world models
- **Constitutional AI Framework** - Principled agent behavior
- **Memory Federation** - Multi-backend unified architecture

## 🎯 Research Foundations

Our work builds upon leading research in context engineering and AI-native systems:
