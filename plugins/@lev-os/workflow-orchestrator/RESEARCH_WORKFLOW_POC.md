# Research Workflow POC - Ultimate Bi-Directional Orchestration

This POC demonstrates how the workflow orchestrator guides Claude through a sophisticated multi-step research process using bi-directional context injection.

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Workflow Architecture

### Step 0: QnA Wizard
- Progressive discovery through initial web search
- Ask clarifying questions based on search results
- Build focused research parameters
- Generate 5 discovery search queries

### Step 1: Discovery Phase
- Execute 5 auto-generated related topic searches
- Use available web search tools (WebSearch, perplexity_ask)
- Gather broad context and identify key themes
- Track all search results and insights

### Step 2: Deep Research Prompt Building
- Apply techniques from ~/t (chain-of-thought, tree-of-thoughts)
- Generate 10 sophisticated research prompts
- Each prompt targets specific aspects discovered in Step 1
- Structure prompts for maximum insight extraction

### Step 3: Deep Research Execution
- Execute each research prompt systematically
- Expect perplexity deep research or similar tools
- Track all outputs comprehensively
- Build knowledge graph from results

### Step 4: Multi-Angle Synthesis
- Apply doc-shepherd synthesis patterns
- Use cognitive parliament for multi-perspective analysis
- Extreme brainstorming for creative insights
- Generate comprehensive research report

        You are a research discovery wizard. Your role:
        
        1. Execute an initial web search based on the user's request
        2. Analyze the results to identify:
           - Key themes and concepts
           - Areas needing clarification
           - Potential research directions
        3. Ask 3-5 clarifying questions to focus the research
        4. Based on answers, generate 5 discovery search queries
        
        Use whatever web search tool is available (WebSearch, perplexity_ask, etc.)

## ðŸš€ How Claude Uses This Workflow

```javascript
// Claude calls the workflow orchestrator
await workflow_execute({
  workflow: 'ultimate-research-workflow',
  input: {
    topic: "AI workflow orchestration patterns",
    initial_context: "Looking for cutting-edge approaches to bi-directional orchestration"
  }
});

// The orchestrator then guides Claude through each step:

// Step 0: QnA Wizard
// Orchestrator injects: "You are a research discovery wizard..."
// Claude: Performs initial search, asks clarifying questions
// Claude: Generates 5 discovery searches based on user responses

// Step 1: Discovery Phase (Parallel)
// Orchestrator injects 5 parallel contexts
// Claude: Executes each discovery search simultaneously
// Claude: Extracts and returns key insights from each

// Step 2: Deep Prompt Building
// Orchestrator injects: "Build 10 deep research prompts using CoT..."
// Claude: Applies prompting techniques to generate sophisticated queries
// Claude: Returns structured research prompts

// Step 3: Deep Research (Parallel)
// Orchestrator injects 10 parallel research contexts
// Claude: Executes each deep research prompt
// Claude: Returns comprehensive findings

// Step 4: Multi-Angle Synthesis (Parallel)
// Orchestrator injects 3 different synthesis contexts
// Claude: Performs doc-shepherd synthesis
// Claude: Conducts cognitive parliament analysis
// Claude: Does extreme brainstorming

// Step 5: Final Report
// Orchestrator injects: "Create comprehensive report..."
// Claude: Synthesizes everything into final deliverable
// Claude: Saves report and returns summary
```

## ðŸ“Š Output Tracking

The orchestrator tracks ALL outputs:
- Search results from discovery phase
- Generated research prompts
- Deep research findings
- Synthesis perspectives
- Final report location

## ðŸ§ª Testing the POC

1. **Simple Test**: Basic research on a straightforward topic
2. **Complex Test**: Multi-faceted topic requiring all capabilities
3. **Stress Test**: Highly ambiguous topic testing QnA wizard

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Innovations

1. **Progressive Discovery**: QnA wizard adapts research based on initial findings
2. **Parallel Execution**: Massive parallelization for speed
3. **Multi-Tool Integration**: Works with any available search/research tools
4. **Technique Application**: Leverages ~/t prompting techniques
5. **Pattern Reuse**: Incorporates ~/c workflows and agents
6. **Comprehensive Tracking**: Every output preserved and synthesized

This represents the ultimate demonstration of bi-directional orchestration where the CLI guides Claude through a sophisticated research journey, with Claude processing each injected context with maximum intelligence.
