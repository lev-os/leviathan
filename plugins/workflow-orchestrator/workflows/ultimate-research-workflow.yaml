    - id: qna_wizard
      name: "Progressive Discovery Wizard"
      instruction: |
        You are a research discovery wizard. Your role:
        
        1. Execute an initial web search based on the user's request
        2. Analyze the results to identify:
           - Key themes and concepts
           - Areas needing clarification
           - Potential research directions
        3. Ask 3-5 clarifying questions to focus the research
        4. Based on answers, generate 5 discovery search queries
        
        Use whatever web search tool is available (WebSearch, perplexity_ask, etc.)
        
        Output format:
        - Initial findings summary
        - Clarifying questions
        - Proposed discovery searches

    - id: deep_prompt_building
      name: "Build Deep Research Prompts"
      instruction: |
        Based on discovery phase results, build 10 deep research prompts using:
        
        Chain-of-Thought Technique:
        - Break down complex topics into logical steps
        - Each prompt should explore one aspect deeply
        
        Tree-of-Thoughts Pattern:
        - Create branching exploration paths
        - Consider multiple perspectives and hypotheses
        
        Research Prompt Structure:
        1. Context from discovery phase
        2. Specific investigation angle
        3. Expected insight types
        4. Validation criteria
        
        Generate 10 sophisticated prompts that will extract maximum insight.
