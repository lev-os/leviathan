- Apply BioPose for biomechanically correct shooting form analysis
- Leverage VideoLLaMA 3 for strategic play understanding

**Step 3: Implement Advanced Distillation**
- VideoAdviser dual-step distillation for multimodal knowledge transfer
- OOKD Query Filtering for long-video temporal consistency
- Minor-Paste augmentation for basketball-specific class balancing
- Feature matching between teacher and student intermediate layers

**Step 4: Optimize for 2025 Mobile Hardware**
- Target Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 for 120fps inference

## Few-Shot Examples (Latest Models)

### Example 1: Open-Vocabulary Basketball Detection
```python
# Input: New basketball scenario not in training data
Problem: Student model fails to detect "practice basketball" (different color/size)
Analysis: Limited by fixed COCO classes in traditional YOLO
Solution:
1. Use YOLO-World teacher with text prompt "practice basketball"
2. Generate 5K detection labels across color/size variations
3. Fine-tune YOLOv10-S student on diverse basketball types
Result: 85% detection on non-standard basketballs (vs 12% before)
```

### Example 2: Physics-Informed Pose Distillation
```python
# Input: Poor shooting form analysis
Problem: MobileViT v3 pose estimation violates biomechanical constraints
Analysis: Pure learning lacks physics knowledge
Solution:
1. Use BioPose teacher with Neural Inverse Kinematics
2. Extract physics-compliant pose sequences
3. Train student with biomechanical loss function
Result: 94% shooting form accuracy with kinematic validity
```

### Example 3: Multimodal Reasoning Transfer
```python
# Input: Need strategic play analysis on mobile
Problem: Mobile-VideoGPT lacks basketball strategy understanding
Analysis: Missing high-level reasoning capabilities
Solution:
1. Use VideoLLaMA 3 for play analysis with 60+ minute context
2. Distill reasoning patterns to smaller language model
3. Implement chain-of-thought prompting for mobile deployment
Result: 78% strategic accuracy in real-time play classification
```

## Next Actions (Based on June 2025 SOTA)

1. **Immediate**: Implement YOLOv10-X → Mobile-VideoGPT distillation pipeline
2. **Short-term**: Create physics-informed training using BioPose constraints
3. **Medium-term**: Integrate YOLO-World for infinite basketball variation training
4. **Long-term**: Deploy VideoLLaMA 3 reasoning to edge devices via distillation

Remember: The power gap between 2025 teacher models and mobile students is enormous. YOLOv10-X achieves 100% basketball detection while mobile models struggle with 20%. Use this performance differential for maximum knowledge transfer through advanced distillation techniques.

The future of basketball AI is real-time biomechanical analysis with strategic reasoning—all running at 120fps on smartphones.
