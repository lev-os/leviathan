    supplier_power: "Low - Open source AI models and cloud infrastructure"  
    buyer_power: "High - VCs and enterprises have many options"
    substitutes_threat: "Medium - Traditional automation and human teams"
  
  strategic_opportunity:
    competitive_advantage: "Research depth + proven clients + vertical expertise"
    market_positioning: "AI-native pioneer vs follower/imitator narrative"
  ```

- **Organizational Truth Assessment**:
  ```yaml
  authenticity_validation:
    current_reality: "Advanced AI research with active client deployments"

    reduce: "Technical complexity messaging, academic emphasis"  
    raise: "Client proof and business results, competitive comparison"
    create: "Vertical agent expertise category, research-to-production advantage"
    
  strategic_canvas:
    industry_factors: ["Capability", "Proof", "Specialization", "Innovation"]
    kingly_positioning: [9, 8, 9, 10]  # High differentiation
    manus_positioning: [7, 5, 6, 7]    # General automation
    genspark_positioning: [8, 4, 5, 8] # Technical but unproven
  ```

    - "Evidence of market timing and execution capability"
  ```

**Define Phase: Problem Synthesis**
- **Point of View Statement**: "VCs need to quickly identify technically superior AI companies with proven commercial execution because the market is flooded with similar-looking super agent startups."

- **How Might We Questions**:
  - "How might we immediately demonstrate technical superiority vs competitors?"
  - "How might we showcase commercial traction and client success?"
  - "How might we position research depth as competitive advantage?"

**Constitutional Validation**: ✅ Human-centered design with LLM-powered insight synthesis

#### MARKETING DOMAIN: Performance Optimization (Hypothesis Formation)
