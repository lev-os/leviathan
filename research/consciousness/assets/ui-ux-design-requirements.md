# FlowMind UI/UX Design Requirements
## Designing Intelligence: From CLI Power to Visual Accessibility

### Design Challenge Overview

**The Fundamental Question**: How do you create a visual interface for a system where the intelligence IS the interface?

FlowMind isn't traditional software with AI features - it's an AI-native intelligence orchestration platform. The CLI works because technical users understand that they're having a conversation with an intelligent system that can apply 200+ expert frameworks to any problem.

**The Design Challenge**: Make this same level of intelligence accessible to non-technical users through visual interactions.

## Interaction Patterns for LLM-First Experiences

### Conversational Interface Design

**The Principle**: Make it feel like talking to an expert advisor, not using software.

#### Natural Language Input
```
Instead of: Select Framework → Porter's Five Forces → Input Company Data → Generate Report

Use: "Analyze the competitive landscape for our SaaS startup in the project management space"

System Response: "I'll analyze your competitive environment using Porter's Five Forces. 
I'll also recommend Blue Ocean Strategy to identify differentiation opportunities. 
Should I include a market sizing analysis as well?"
```

#### AI-Driven Suggestions
```
User Input: "Help me improve our onboarding"

System Analysis:
🎯 I detect this is about user experience optimization. 
   I recommend starting with User Journey Mapping to understand current experience.

📋 Suggested Workflow:
   1. Map current onboarding journey
   2. Apply Jobs-to-be-Done to understand user motivations
   3. Use Design Thinking Process for improvement ideation
   4. Create A/B testing plan for validation

🤔 Questions to improve my recommendations:
   • What type of onboarding? (product, employee, customer)
   • What's the main problem you're seeing?
   • Do you have current user feedback or data?

## Visual Design Principles

### Intelligence-First Aesthetics

**Principle**: The interface should feel intelligent, not just functional.

#### Design Language
- **Colors**: Convey confidence and intelligence (deep blues, sophisticated grays)
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy that guides attention to insights
- **Icons**: Abstract but meaningful (not literal tools, but conceptual representations)
- **Layout**: Breathing room that doesn't overwhelm with information density

#### Information Hierarchy
```
1. PRIMARY: Key insights and recommendations (large, prominent)
2. SECONDARY: Supporting analysis and context (medium, accessible)  
3. TERTIARY: Detailed data and methodology (small, available on demand)
```

### Progressive Disclosure of Complexity

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### State Management for Intelligence

**Challenge**: AI conversations create complex, branching state trees.

**Solution**: Session-Based State Architecture

```javascript
// Session state structure
{
  session_id: "unique-id",
  current_workflow: {
    active_contexts: ["competitive-analysis", "market-research"],
    step: 3,
    decisions_made: [/* previous choices */],
    pending_decisions: [/* awaiting user input */],
    ai_confidence: 0.87
  },
  project_data: {
    inputs: {/* user data */},
    intermediate_results: {/* AI analysis */},
    final_outputs: {/* completed work */}
  },
  ui_state: {
    complexity_level: "intermediate",
    preferred_output_format: "visual",
    mobile_optimizations: true
  }
}
```

### Component Architecture for Dynamic Intelligence

**Requirement**: Components must handle dynamic complexity and AI-driven content.

**Recommended Pattern**: Intelligence-Aware Components

```jsx
// Example: Smart Context Selector
<ContextSelector 
  userIntent="improve customer retention"
  currentProject={projectData}
  onRecommendations={(contexts) => handleAIRecommendations(contexts)}
  complexityLevel={user.experienceLevel}
  collaborators={teamMembers}
/>

// Component automatically:
// - Runs semantic search
// - Applies user context
// - Suggests combinations
// - Adapts to complexity level
// - Handles team coordination
```
