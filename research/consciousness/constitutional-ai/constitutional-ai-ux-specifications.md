# Constitutional AI Interface: UX/UI Specifications

## Executive Summary

This specification defines the first constitutional AI-native interface that demonstrates personal data fractals, polymorphic input handling, and intelligence coordination. The interface embodies the principle "Where's the LLM in this?" by making AI reasoning visible throughout the user experience.

**Paradigm Shift**: From static interfaces to dynamic personal data fractals that evolve through natural AI interaction.
