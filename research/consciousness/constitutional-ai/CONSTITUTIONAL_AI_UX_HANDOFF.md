## 10. Competitive Differentiation

This is not another AI chatbot interface. Constitutional AI represents a fundamental paradigm shift:

**Traditional Software**: Human learns tool → performs task → gets result
**Constitutional AI**: Human states intent → AI orchestrates intelligence → collaborative refinement → optimal outcome

The interface must embody this partnership model, making users feel like they're working WITH an intelligent system rather than using a tool.
