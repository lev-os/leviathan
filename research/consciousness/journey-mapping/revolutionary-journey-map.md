## Journey Flow: Discovery to Mastery

### Phase 1: Constitutional AI Introduction (Discovery)
**Duration**: 15-30 minutes
**Trigger**: User arrives seeking "AI solution" or "business intelligence"
**Constitutional Check**: ✅ LLM reasoning demonstration from first interaction

#### User Actions & Thoughts
- **Arrives**: Looking for "another AI tool" or "BI dashboard"
- **Encounters**: "What do you want?" instead of feature menus
- **Thinks**: "This is different - it's actually asking me what I need"
- **Experiences**: Natural conversation that extracts requirements

#### System AI Responses (Constitutional Reasoning)
```yaml
interaction_pattern:
  input: "I need better business insights"
  ai_reasoning: |
    ψ: Quantum scan - user seeks intelligence amplification, not task automation
    λ: Synthesis - business context extraction through conversation
    Ω: Emergence - unique solution crystallizes from user's actual needs
    ∇: Flow optimization - guide toward value creation, not feature consumption
```

#### Revolutionary Elements Demonstrated
- **Dynamic Compression**: One question extracts what traditional forms need 5 fields for
- **Constitutional Wellness**: "It's getting late - would you like me to set this up in the background while you rest?"
