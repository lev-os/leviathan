## üéØ CONSTITUTIONAL FRONTEND PRINCIPLES

### Core Constitutional Frontend Principles

#### Principle 1: "Constitutional Component Implementation"
```yaml
constitutional_component_principle:
  frontend_requirement: "React components implement constitutional AI principles through component design rather than external configuration"
  implementation: "Constitutional transparency, emergence, and orchestration as core component capabilities"
  constitutional_benefit: "Constitutional compliance through component architecture rather than policy enforcement"
  validation: "Constitutional principle adherence through React component implementation effectiveness"
```

#### Principle 2: "YAML-Native Frontend Interface"
```yaml
yaml_native_frontend_principle:
  frontend_requirement: "Constitutional workflows configured through conversational YAML interface rather than traditional form components"
  implementation: "Constitutional YAML generation React components with constitutional validation integration"
  constitutional_benefit: "Preserves constitutional reasoning flow through frontend implementation"
  validation: "Constitutional workflow specification effectiveness through YAML-native React interface"
```
