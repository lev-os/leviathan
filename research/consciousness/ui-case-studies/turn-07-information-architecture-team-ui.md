## 👥 CEO ORCHESTRATION: INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE ACTIVATION

**CEO Intelligence Compilation**: Analyzing user research findings revealing AI-native behavior patterns, three-tier sophistication progression, and preference for semantic discovery over navigation hierarchies. Information Architecture team activated to design constitutional compliance navigation supporting 200+ context orchestration.

**Specialist Team Activated**:
- **Primary**: Information Architect (lead designer)
- **Supporting**: Taxonomy Designer, Search Specialist, Content Strategist

## 🏗️ INFORMATION ARCHITECT ANALYSIS

### Constitutional Information Architecture Principles

**LLM-Reasoning Driven Organization**: Instead of traditional card sorting and tree testing, we design semantic discovery systems through constitutional lens:

1. **Semantic Context Organization**: How do 200+ contexts cluster through AI reasoning rather than human categorization?
2. **Constitutional Compliance Navigation**: How does information hierarchy support real-time constitutional validation?
3. **Progressive Disclosure Architecture**: How does information complexity scale with user sophistication?
4. **Emergent Structure Support**: How does IA adapt as users create new workflow patterns?
