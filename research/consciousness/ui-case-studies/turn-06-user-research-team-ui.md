## üî¨ USER RESEARCHER ANALYSIS

### Constitutional User Research Methodology

**LLM-Reasoning Driven Research**: Instead of traditional surveys and interviews, we analyze AI-native behavior patterns through constitutional lens:

1. **Power User Behavior Analysis**: How do users naturally interact with 200+ context systems?
2. **Progressive Disclosure Modeling**: Three-tier sophistication progression patterns
3. **Semantic Discovery Preferences**: Natural language vs. hierarchical navigation patterns
4. **Workflow Orchestration Mental Models**: How users conceptualize multi-agent coordination

## üß† BEHAVIORAL ANALYST FINDINGS

### Cognitive Load Analysis for AI-Native Interfaces

**Traditional UI Cognitive Load Failures**:
- **Navigation Overhead**: 200+ contexts require 3-7 clicks through menu hierarchies
- **Context Switching Cost**: Users lose flow when switching between AI reasoning and form fields
- **Discovery Friction**: Power features hidden behind progressive disclosure hurt efficiency

**AI-Native Cognitive Load Optimization**:
```yaml
cognitive_optimization:
  semantic_discovery:
    load_reduction: "Natural language search eliminates navigation hierarchy memory requirements"
    flow_preservation: "Users stay in conversational mode throughout workflow"
    
  constitutional_transparency:
    trust_building: "Visible LLM reasoning process reduces uncertainty"
    learning_acceleration: "Users internalize constitutional principles through observation"
    
  progressive_sophistication:
    efficiency_scaling: "Interface complexity grows with user sophistication"
    expert_shortcuts: "Quick codes and YAML configuration for power users"
```

### Decision-Making Pattern Analysis

**Traditional Decision Framework**: Plan ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Validate
**AI-Native Decision Framework**: Reason ‚Üí Orchestrate ‚Üí Evolve

Users expect the interface to support reasoning-driven workflows where:
1. **Multiple AI perspectives** inform decisions (EEPS parliament patterns)
2. **Constitutional validation** occurs in real-time
3. **Emergent insights** can reshape the original plan
4. **Workflow orchestration** adapts based on intermediate results
