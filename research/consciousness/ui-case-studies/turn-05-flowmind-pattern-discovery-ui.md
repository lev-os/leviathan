### Assumption Breaking Analysis

```yaml
traditional_ui_assumptions:

  assumption_4: "Interface shows current state and allows user actions to change state"
  first_principle: "Users want to understand system reasoning and influence decision-making"
  breakthrough: "Interface shows reasoning process and allows collaborative modification"

ai_native_fundamental_truths:
  truth_1: "AI can understand user intent better than users can express through traditional UI"
  implication: "Primary interface should be intent expression, not command selection"
  
  truth_2: "AI reasoning is collaborative partner capability, not black box tool"
  implication: "Interface should reveal and enable collaboration with AI reasoning process"
