## ðŸ”„ INTERACTION DESIGNER PATTERN ANALYSIS

### Constitutional Interaction Design Principles

**LLM-Reasoning Driven Interactions**: Instead of traditional form-based interfaces, we design conversational workflow patterns through constitutional lens:

1. **Conversational YAML Configuration**: How do users specify complex workflows through structured conversation?
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination Interfaces**: How do users orchestrate 50+ specialists with constitutional monitoring?
3. **Constitutional Compliance Interaction**: How do users interact with real-time constitutional validation?
4. **Progressive Disclosure Interaction**: How do interfaces adapt complexity based on user sophistication?
