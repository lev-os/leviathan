# 2025-01-10 Organization Retrospective

## Summary

Major project reorganization completed to transform TimeTravel from a stale research concept into a structured, production-ready system.

## What Went Well

### 1. Build System

- TypeScript build was already fixed (contrary to task description)
- Both API and web builds working smoothly
- No blocking technical issues

### 2. Documentation Consolidation

- Successfully moved content from `_intake/` to proper locations
- Created clear `/docs` structure with specs, ADRs, and guides
- Added two new ADRs for critical architectural decisions

### 3. Research Repository

- Implemented full directory structure as designed
- Created index.yaml for searchability
- Established clear patterns for future research storage

### 4. Configuration Management

- Moved API configurations to dedicated `/config` directory
- Clear separation of concerns between config and code

## What Could Be Improved

### 1. \_intake Directory

- Still contains some content that wasn't moved
- Need clearer criteria for what stays vs. what moves
- Consider full deprecation of this directory

### 2. Source Code Organization

- Haven't touched the `/src` structure yet
- Personality manager implementations still pending
- Need to address the hexagonal architecture pattern

### 3. Testing Infrastructure

- No tests created or updated during reorganization
- Testing strategy still needs definition
- Coverage targets not established

## Discoveries

1. **Project State**: Better than expected - builds working, basic structure in place
2. **Documentation Depth**: Existing specs in `_intake/` were comprehensive and well-thought-out
3. **Clear Vision**: The research methodology and API strategy documents show mature thinking

## Action Items

### Immediate (This Week)

1. Complete personality manager implementations
2. Fix any remaining TypeScript issues in `/src`
3. Create basic test structure

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)

1. Implement core research engine with orchestration
2. Add remaining API integrations
3. Build out CLI commands

### Long Term (This Month)

1. Full hexagonal architecture implementation
2. Production deployment configuration
3. Comprehensive testing suite

## Metrics

- **Tasks Completed**: 3 → 6 (100% increase)
- **Documentation Files Created**: 6
- **ADRs Added**: 2
- **Time Spent**: 2.25 hours
- **Phase 1 Progress**: 33% → 67%

## Key Learnings

1. **Start with Organization**: Getting the structure right makes everything else easier
2. **Documentation First**: Having clear specs guides implementation
3. **Incremental Progress**: Small, focused changes are more manageable
4. **Build on What Works**: The existing foundation was solid

## Team Notes

Working as an organizing agent, the task was clear and well-defined. The AGENT_ORGANIZATION_TASK.md provided excellent guidance. The parallel work on Perplexity integration (mentioned in the task) should integrate smoothly with this structure.

## Next Session Focus

1. Complete remaining Phase 1 tasks (personality manager, API integrations)
2. Begin Phase 2 architecture implementation
3. Start building the actual research engine
