# Archive Directory

This directory contains reference code, examples, demos, and deprecated implementations that may be useful for future development but are not part of the production codebase.

## Purpose

- **Reference Code**: Working implementations that were replaced or refactored
- **Examples**: Demo code and usage examples
- **Experiments**: Half-baked features and experimental implementations
- **Deprecated**: Old versions of features that may be referenced

## Guidelines

- All code in this directory should be considered non-production
- Include clear documentation about why code was archived
- Preserve working examples that demonstrate concepts
- Keep archive organized with subdirectories by topic/feature

## Archive Structure

```
_archive/
├── examples/         # Working examples and demos
├── experiments/      # Experimental implementations
├── deprecated/       # Replaced production code
└── reference/        # Reference implementations
```

*Note: This directory was created during the TimeTravel consolidation process and is currently empty. It will be populated as the project evolves and code is refactored or replaced.*
