# Milestone: v0.1 MVP

## Overview

**Version**: 0.1  
**Name**: Minimum Viable Product  
**Target Date**: 2025-01-31  
**Status**: In Progress

## Objectives

The v0.1 MVP establishes TimeTravel as a functional AI research platform with basic multi-API orchestration capabilities.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Working CLI interface for research commands
- [ ] Integration with at least 3 research APIs
- [ ] Basic research repository with search
- [ ] Personality system implementation
- [ ] Documentation complete for all features

## Required Features

### 1. Core Research Engine

- [ ] Perplexity Sonar integration (via MCP)
- [ ] Multi-tool orchestration pattern
- [ ] Basic result validation
- [ ] JSON/YAML output formats

### 2. CLI Interface

- [ ] `timetravel research <topic>` command
- [ ] `timetravel personality <mode>` command
- [ ] `timetravel status` command
- [ ] Configuration management

### 3. Research Repository

- [ ] File-based storage system
- [ ] Index-based search
- [ ] Topic and horizon organization
- [ ] Basic deduplication

### 4. Personality System

- [ ] Load personality configurations
- [ ] Apply personality perspectives
- [ ] Synthesis with personality lens
- [ ] At least 3 core personalities

### 5. Documentation

- [ ] Complete README
- [ ] Quick start guide
- [ ] API integration guide
- [ ] Research methodology docs

## Technical Requirements

- TypeScript build passing
- Basic test coverage (>50%)
- Error handling for API failures
- Rate limiting implementation
- Configuration validation

## Excluded from MVP

- Web UI (CLI only)
- Advanced APIs (Elicit, DeepSeek)
- Real-time monitoring
- Automated scheduling
- Cost tracking dashboard

## Acceptance Tests

1. **Research Flow Test**

   ```bash
   timetravel research "subquadratic attention mechanisms"
   # Should return structured research with sources
   ```

2. **Personality Test**

   ```bash
   timetravel personality abundance_amplifier
   timetravel research "AI efficiency improvements"
   # Should show personality-influenced analysis
   ```

3. **Repository Test**
   ```bash
   timetravel search "attention"
   # Should find previous research on attention
   ```

## Risk Mitigation

- **API Rate Limits**: Implement exponential backoff
- **Cost Overrun**: Hard budget limits in config
- **Quality Issues**: Validation scoring system
- **Integration Complexity**: Start with single API

## Dependencies

- Perplexity API key configured
- MCP tools available in Cursor
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git for version control

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All features implemented and tested
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Code review passed
- [ ] Manual QA completed
- [ ] Tagged as v0.1.0 in Git
