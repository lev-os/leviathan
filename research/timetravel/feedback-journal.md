# TimeTravel Dogfooding Feedback Journal

## Purpose
Capture insights from using Leviathan patterns to build TimeTravel, feeding back into Leviathan design.

## Feedback Entries

### Entry 1: Initial Build Experience
**Date**: 2025-01-06
**Phase**: Infrastructure Creation

**What Worked Well**:
- Clear separation of contexts (agents, tools, workflows, patterns)
- @lev-os/core reference pattern enables clean modularity
- Personality patterns provide rich multi-perspective analysis
- Three-tier workflow creates natural research progression

**Pain Points Discovered**:
- Need better context discovery mechanisms
- Script-based simulation highlights need for real Leviathan CLI
- Memory system could benefit from vector embeddings
- Tool orchestration patterns need refinement

**Suggested Improvements**:
1. **Context Discovery**: Add context search/browse functionality
2. **CLI Design**: Based on simulation scripts, CLI should support:
   - `lev context load <reference>`
   - `lev research <topic> --workflow three-tier`
   - `lev personality <mode>`
   - `lev memory search <query>`
3. **Memory Enhancement**: Integrate vector DB for semantic search
4. **Tool Orchestration**: Create tool composition patterns

**Impact on Leviathan Design**:
- Validates FlowMind bidirectional architecture
- Confirms value of personality-based reasoning
- Shows need for better developer experience tooling

## Summary Insights

### Architecture Validation
- ✅ Context-based architecture scales well
- ✅ YAML-first configuration is intuitive
- ✅ Separation of config from prompts works
- ⚠️  Need better context inheritance mechanisms

### Workflow Patterns
- ✅ Three-tier progression feels natural
- ✅ Dynamic tier 2 generation is powerful
- ✅ Personality synthesis adds depth
- ⚠️  Could use more workflow composition tools

### Developer Experience
- ✅ Reference pattern (@lev-os/core) is clean
- ⚠️  Need real CLI to replace bash scripts
- ⚠️  Context validation could be stronger
- ⚠️  Documentation generation would help

### Next Steps
1. Build Leviathan CLI based on these patterns
2. Enhance memory with embeddings
3. Create context browser/search tool
4. Add workflow composition features
