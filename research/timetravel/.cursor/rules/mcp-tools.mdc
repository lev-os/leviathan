# MCP Tools Guidelines

## Tool Development

- Follow MCP protocol specifications for tool definitions
- Implement proper input validation for all tool parameters
- Use consistent error handling across all MCP tools
- Document tool capabilities and usage patterns

## API Integration

- Implement proper authentication for external APIs
- Use environment variables for API keys and configuration
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Track API usage and costs for optimization

## Research API Tools

- Perplexity: Use for AI-powered research and analysis
- Brave/EXA/Tavily: Use for web search and content discovery
- Firecrawl: Use for web scraping and content extraction
- Desktop Commander: Use for local file operations

## Tool Orchestration

- Coordinate multiple API calls efficiently
- Implement parallel processing where possible
- Use appropriate timeouts for each tool type
- Cache results to minimize redundant API calls

## Error Handling

- Implement graceful degradation when tools are unavailable
- Provide meaningful error messages for tool failures
- Log tool usage and errors for debugging
- Handle rate limiting and quota exhaustion

## Cost Management

- Monitor API costs across all integrated tools
- Implement cost thresholds and alerts
- Use caching to reduce unnecessary API calls
- Provide cost estimates for research operations

## Development Tools

- Use dry-run mode for testing without API costs
- Implement tool health checks and status monitoring
- Create mock implementations for development
- Test tool integration in isolation

## Security

- Never expose API keys in code or logs
- Use secure environment variable management
- Validate all tool inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper access controls for sensitive operations

## Configuration

- Store tool configurations in config/ directory
- Use YAML for tool and API configurations
- Implement configuration validation on startup
- Support multiple environment configurations (dev, staging, prod)
