# Testing Guidelines

## Test Structure

- Use Jest for unit and integration testing
- Follow BDD scenarios in specs/features/ for behavior testing
- Write tests before implementing new features (TDD approach)
- Group related tests in describe blocks with clear names

## Unit Testing

- Test each function in isolation with mocked dependencies
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Aim for high test coverage but focus on critical paths

## Integration Testing

- Test API endpoints with real request/response cycles
- Test research workflow execution with dry-run mode
- Validate configuration file parsing and validation
- Test MCP tool integration with mock responses

## BDD Scenarios

- Write Gherkin scenarios for user-facing features
- Use Given/When/Then structure consistently
- Test personality switching and research execution workflows
- Validate research plan configuration scenarios

## Research Testing

- Always use dry-run mode for testing research plans
- Mock external API calls to prevent costs during testing
- Test research result parsing and synthesis
- Validate memory system integration

## Test Data

- Use fixtures for consistent test data
- Create minimal test research plans
- Mock API responses for deterministic testing
- Store test artifacts in temporary directories

## Performance Testing

- Test API response times under load
- Validate memory usage for large research operations
- Test concurrent research execution
- Monitor and assert on API cost limits

## CI/CD Integration

- All tests must pass before merging
- Run linting and type checking as part of test pipeline
- Test both development and production builds
- Validate that research workflows still function after changes

## Error Testing

- Test error handling and recovery scenarios
- Validate proper error messages and logging
- Test timeout and retry logic
- Ensure graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
