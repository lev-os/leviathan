## Research Workflow Architecture

### Meta-Prompting Strategy: "5 Deep Researches Per Topic"

```yaml
deep_research_workflow:
  name: "Multi-Perspective Deep Research"
  description: "Conduct 5 parallel deep researches with synthesis"
  
  phases:
    1_initial_scan:
      tool: "perplexity_sonar"
      action: "Broad topic exploration"
      queries: 3-5
      output: "Key themes and subtopics"
    
    2_deep_dives:
      parallel_researches:
        - perspective: "Technical Implementation"
          tool: "perplexity_deep_research"
          focus: "Architecture, code, technical details"
        
        - perspective: "Academic Research"
          tool: "elicit"
          focus: "Papers, theories, methodologies"
        
        - perspective: "Market/Industry"
          tool: "perplexity_sonar"
          focus: "Companies, products, adoption"
        
        - perspective: "User Impact"
          tool: "perplexity_sonar"
          focus: "Use cases, problems solved, friction"
        
        - perspective: "Future Implications"
          tool: "deepseek"
          focus: "Trajectories, scenarios, risks"
    
    3_synthesis:
      tool: "claude_3.5"
      action: "Meta-analysis of all perspectives"
      output: "Integrated insights and recommendations"
    
    4_validation:
      tool: "deepseek"
      action: "Fact-check and verify key claims"
      output: "Confidence ratings"
```

### Research Query Templates

#### Technology Assessment Template
```yaml
template: technology_assessment
variables:
  - technology_name
  - time_horizon
  - impact_area

queries:
  technical_depth: |
    Deep technical analysis of {technology_name}:
    - Core architecture and innovations
    - Performance benchmarks
    - Implementation requirements
    - Technical limitations
  
  competitive_landscape: |
    {technology_name} competitive analysis:
    - Major players and their approaches
    - Open source vs proprietary
    - Cost comparisons
    - Adoption barriers
  
  integration_potential: |
    How to integrate {technology_name} with semantic orchestration:
    - API availability
    - Protocol compatibility
    - Performance implications
    - User experience impact
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Pattern

```javascript
// Conceptual implementation
class DeepResearchOrchestrator {
  async conductResearch(topic, config) {
    // Phase 1: Parallel information gathering
    const perspectives = await Promise.all([
      this.technicalResearch(topic),
      this.academicResearch(topic),
      this.marketResearch(topic),
      this.userResearch(topic),
      this.futureResearch(topic)
    ]);
    
    // Phase 2: Cross-validation
    const validated = await this.crossValidate(perspectives);
    
    // Phase 3: Synthesis
    const synthesis = await this.synthesize(validated);
    
    // Phase 4: Actionable insights
    const recommendations = await this.generateRecommendations(synthesis);
    
    return {
      raw_perspectives: perspectives,
      validated_facts: validated,
      synthesis: synthesis,
      recommendations: recommendations,
      confidence_scores: this.calculateConfidence(validated)
    };
  }
}
```
