# Output: Weekly strategic intelligence report
```

### Multi-Horizon Analysis
```bash
# Horizon-specific research
./kingly-sim.sh horizon-research "subquadratic attention" --horizon 2yr
# Personality-driven strategic analysis
./kingly-sim.sh strategic-personality sovereignty_architect "competitive threats"
```

### Competitive Intelligence
```bash
# Automated competitive monitoring
./kingly-sim.sh competitive-intel --companies "anthropic,openai,deepseek"
# Deep strategic positioning analysis
./kingly-sim.sh positioning-analysis "world models"
```
