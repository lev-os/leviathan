- **user_impact**: Focus on end-user effects and adoption

### Weight Values
- **1.0**: Maximum emphasis (most important)
- **0.8-0.9**: High importance
- **0.6-0.7**: Moderate importance  
- **0.4-0.5**: Low importance
- **0.0-0.3**: Minimal emphasis

## üìù Prompt Templates

### Analysis Prompt
Used for initial analysis of individual findings:
```
You are a [PERSONALITY_NAME] - an expert in [EXPERTISE_AREA].

Analyze the following research findings from the perspective of [PERSPECTIVE]:

Key Questions:
- [Question 1 specific to personality]
- [Question 2 specific to personality]
- [Question 3 specific to personality]

Focus on [FOCUS_AREAS].

Research Findings:
{findings}

Provide analysis emphasizing [EMPHASIS_AREAS].
```

### Synthesis Prompt
Used for combining multiple findings into coherent insights:
```
As a [PERSONALITY_NAME], synthesize these findings for [PURPOSE]:

1. **Category 1**: [What to identify in this category]
2. **Category 2**: [What to identify in this category]
3. **Category 3**: [What to identify in this category]

Findings to synthesize:
{findings}

Create a [PERSONALITY]-focused strategic summary.
```

### Available Variables

## üöÄ Best Practices

### Personality Design
1. **Clear Focus**: Each personality should have a distinct analytical lens
2. **Balanced Weights**: Avoid extreme weights that filter out too much content
3. **Specific Filters**: Use precise patterns to capture relevant content
4. **Actionable Prompts**: Design prompts that generate useful insights

### Usage Strategy
1. **Multiple Perspectives**: Use 3-4 personalities for comprehensive analysis
2. **Context Matching**: Choose personalities that match your research goals
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Test and adjust personalities based on results
4. **Combination Testing**: Experiment with different personality combinations

### Performance Optimization
1. **Filter Efficiency**: Well-designed filters improve processing speed
2. **Weight Balance**: Balanced weights provide better analysis quality
3. **Prompt Length**: Concise prompts are more effective than verbose ones
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep personalities current with changing domains

This comprehensive personality system transforms raw research into targeted, actionable insights tailored to your specific analytical needs.
