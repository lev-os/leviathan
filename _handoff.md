- Bi-directional MCP communication patterns
- FlowMind workflow orchestration

**Why Important:** Defines the architectural constraints and opportunities for browser integration
**Changes Made:** None - analysis only
**Context for Next Session:** Leviathan uses contexts to configure LLM behavior, not hardcoded logic

---

âš¡ CHECKPOINT 4: Synthesis Document Creation

**Current State:** Creating comprehensive integration concepts
**Context:** Documenting how browser intelligence could work within Leviathan
**Files Modified:**

- tmp/browser-leviathan-synthesis.md
- tmp/browser-leviathan-implementation.md
  **Progress:** Created detailed synthesis showing cognitive parliament concept and multi-personality analysis
  **Next Steps:** Formalize architecture in ADRs
  **Session ID:** browser-leviathan-integration-004

**Context:** Converting concepts into official Architecture Decision Records  
**Files Modified:**

- docs/adr/009-llm-first-browser-intelligence.md
- docs/adr/010-browser-persona-context-switching.md
- docs/adr/011-browser-intelligence-pipeline.md
  **Progress:** Created three ADRs documenting browser intelligence architecture
  **Next Steps:** Wait for user feedback on architecture approach
  **Session ID:** browser-leviathan-integration-005

ðŸ“‹ User feedback / ADR created

**Why Important:** User corrected fundamental misunderstanding: "persona switching makes no sense, this is a pipeline and lev sits at the middleware"
**Changes Made:** Corrected ADR-011 to reflect proper pipeline architecture: Web Content â†’ CB Scraper â†’ Leviathan Intelligence Middleware â†’ Insights  
**Context for Next Session:** Critical correction - Leviathan processes scraped content, doesn't do browser-level persona switching

---

âš¡ CHECKPOINT 6: Architecture Correction & POC Planning

**Current State:** Redesigning based on user feedback
**Context:** Understanding Leviathan as middleware layer, not browser controller
**Files Modified:** docs/adr/011-browser-intelligence-pipeline.md (corrected)
**Progress:** Corrected architecture understanding, planned POC development
**Next Steps:** Build working POC using ClaudeBrowser infrastructure
**Session ID:** browser-leviathan-integration-006

ðŸ“‹ Key Decision: Pipeline vs Persona Architecture

**Why Important:** Fundamental shift from browser-level intelligence to content processing pipeline
**Changes Made:** Redesigned architecture as: CB Scraper â†’ Raw Content â†’ Leviathan Middleware â†’ Intelligence
**Context for Next Session:** This correction is crucial - Leviathan processes scraped content, doesn't control browser behavior

---

âš¡ CHECKPOINT 7: Initial POC Development

**Current State:** Building proof-of-concept at ~/cb
**Context:** Using ClaudeBrowser infrastructure for scraping layer
**Files Modified:**

- /Users/jean-patricksmith/cb/leviathan_middleware_poc.py

  **Session ID:** browser-leviathan-integration-007

ðŸ“‹ Code Context: ~/cb/leviathan_middleware_poc.py:1-50
Initial POC attempted to demonstrate:

- CB content scraping
- Basic Leviathan middleware processing
- Output generation

**Why Important:** First concrete implementation attempt
**Changes Made:** Created POC file but had execution issues
**Context for Next Session:** This POC had problems - the bi-directional version worked better

---

âš¡ CHECKPOINT 8: Bi-Directional POC Success

**Current State:** Working POC demonstrating full pipeline
**Context:** Successfully created bi-directional flow demonstration

  **Next Steps:** Enhance with real LLM processing and better CB extraction
  **Session ID:** browser-leviathan-integration-008

ðŸ“‹ Code Context: ~/cb/leviathan_bidirectional_poc.py:45-80

```python
bidirectional_payload = {
    "scraped_content": {
        "title": "The Python Tutorial â€” Python 3.13.5 documentation",
        "h1_elements": ["The Python Tutorial"],
        "links": [...],
        "url": "https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html"
    },
    "context_instructions": {
        "load_contexts": [

    }
}
```

**Why Important:** Demonstrates working bi-directional flow where LLM receives both content AND configuration instructions
**Changes Made:** Created working POC with actual output generation
**Context for Next Session:** This is the successful implementation pattern - CB provides structured data + Leviathan context instructions together

---

âš¡ CHECKPOINT 9: Final Architecture Validation

**Current State:** Validated working architecture pattern

## Next Agent System Prompt

You are inheriting a session focused on browser intelligence integration with Leviathan. Here's what you need to understand:

### Critical Context to Load:

1. **ADRs**: Load `docs/adr/009-llm-first-browser-intelligence.md`, `docs/adr/010-browser-persona-context-switching.md`, `docs/adr/011-browser-intelligence-pipeline.md` - These contain the architectural decisions, with ADR-011 being the corrected pipeline approach.

2. **Working POC**: Examine `/Users/jean-patricksmith/cb/leviathan_bidirectional_poc.py` - This is the successful implementation demonstrating CB â†’ Leviathan flow.

3. **Synthesis Documents**: Review `tmp/browser-leviathan-synthesis.md` and `tmp/browser-leviathan-implementation.md` for conceptual background.

4. **Output Example**: Check `/Users/jean-patricksmith/cb/leviathan_output/python_tutorial_analysis.json` to see working output.

### Key Understanding Required:

- **Architecture**: CB is pure scraping layer, Leviathan is intelligence middleware
- **Flow**: Web Content â†’ CB Scraper â†’ Leviathan Intelligence Middleware â†’ Insights
- **Bi-Directional**: LLM receives both scraped content AND context instructions together
- **User Correction**: "Persona switching makes no sense, this is a pipeline and lev sits at the middleware"

### Immediate Next Steps:

1. **Real LLM Processing**: Enhance the POC to actually call Leviathan's LLM with contexts
2. **Enhanced CB Extraction**: Improve ClaudeBrowser's content extraction capabilities
3. **Integration Testing**: Test the full pipeline with various web content types

### Validation Checklist:

- [ ] Do you understand CB is just a scraper, not an intelligent agent?
- [ ] Do you understand Leviathan processes scraped content via contexts/workflows?
- [ ] Have you reviewed the working bi-directional POC?
- [ ] Do you understand the user's correction about pipeline vs persona architecture?

**Context Confidence Score**: Please provide a score (1-10) after loading these files indicating your confidence in understanding the current state. Scores below 7 should prompt questions to ensure proper context reconstruction.

### Session Continuity:

- Use session ID format: browser-leviathan-integration-XXX
- Reference this handoff document for historical context
- Build upon the working POC, don't restart from scratch
- Remember: Simple pipeline with intelligent middleware, not complex browser AI
