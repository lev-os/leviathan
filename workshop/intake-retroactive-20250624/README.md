# Workshop Retroactive Intake Handoff Package

## üéØ Overview

This package consolidates AI/ML repository analysis and intake work originally performed in `~/digital/homie` that belongs in `~/lev/workshop`. The analysis was completed using the proper workshop intake processes but in the wrong directory.

## üìÖ Timeline

## üìä Analysis Summary

### Repositories Analyzed (18 Total)

- **Moved (12):** The AI/ML repos physically present
- **Analyzed Only (6):** AutoGPT, Skyvern, llama3, Gemma, DINO, DINOv2, etc.

### Classification Results

- **Tier 1-2 (Production/Advanced):** 44% of analyzed repos
- **Tier 3-4 (Emerging/Research):** 39% of analyzed repos
- **Tier 5-6 (Experimental/Reference):** 17% of analyzed repos

### Integration Recommendations

- **Immediate Implementation:** 8 repositories
- **Research Integration:** 7 repositories
- **Pattern Extraction:** 1 repository
- **Reference Only:** 2 repositories

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Relocate to Workshop

```bash
# Move the entire handoff package
mv tmp/workshop-handoff ~/lev/workshop/intake-retroactive-2025

# Or to a timestamped directory
mv tmp/workshop-handoff ~/lev/workshop/intake-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### 2. Update Workshop Tracking

- Update all repository paths in the tracking system
- Mark retroactive intake as complete
- Sync with external-tools-research workflows

### 3. Verify Integration

```bash
# Run workshop verification
lev workshop verify ~/lev/workshop/intake-retroactive-2025

# Check tracking status
lev workshop status --detailed
```

### 4. Generate Final Synthesis

- Cross-repository pattern extraction
- Technology stack recommendations
- Integration priority matrix
- Timeline estimates

## üìù Important Notes

### Valid Analysis

All analysis remains valid despite the directory mismatch. The workshop intake system was used correctly - only the location needs updating.

### Additional Projects

The following projects were identified but NOT moved (as requested):

- **mpup-labs/** - Multi-project mono-repo with trader-stack, convex, etc.
- **Other projects:** pickaxe, empire-monorepo, tent-flex, what, sites, browser_auth, yt

Note: mpup-labs was identified as an interesting candidate for future Leviathan intake processing.

### Path Updates Required

When moving to workshop, update all paths in:

- Workshop tracking CSV
- External-tools-research workflows
- Integration documentation

## üîó Key Files

### Must Read First

1. `HANDOFF_MANIFEST.json` - Complete package metadata
2. `documentation/synthesis/WORKSHOP_INTAKE_SYNTHESIS.md` - Main synthesis
3. `analysis/intake-results/DETAILED_REPOSITORY_ANALYSIS.md` - Full 18-repo analysis

### Integration Planning

1. `analysis/intake-results/INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md` - Detailed integration plans
2. `analysis/intake-results/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - Implementation timeline
3. `documentation/adrs/` - Architectural decisions

### Data & Tracking

1. `analysis/data/WORKSHOP_TRACKING_FINAL.csv` - Current tracking status
2. `analysis/data/repository-decisions-final.json` - Integration decisions
3. `analysis/data/priority-repositories-strategic-analysis.json` - Strategic analysis

## üéØ Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ All AI/ML repositories consolidated by tier
- ‚úÖ Complete analysis documentation preserved
- ‚úÖ Processing scripts and data maintained
- ‚úÖ Clear path for workshop relocation
- ‚úÖ mpup-labs noted for future consideration
