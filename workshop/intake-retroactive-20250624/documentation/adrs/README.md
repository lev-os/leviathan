**Generated**: 2025-06-19  
**Source**: Workshop LLM-First Intake System  
**Total ADRs**: 7

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Decisions

The following repositories have been approved for integration into the Kingly ecosystem based on LLM-first analysis and strategic alignment:

| ADR | Repository | Type | Status | Priority |
|-----|------------|------|--------|----------|
| [ADR-001](./ADR-001-integrate-autogpt.md) | [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT) | Python Agent Framework | PROPOSED | HIGH |
| [ADR-002](./ADR-002-integrate-skyvern.md) | [skyvern](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern) | Browser Automation + LLM | PROPOSED | HIGH |
| [ADR-003](./ADR-003-integrate-llama3.md) | [llama3](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3) | Foundation Language Model | PROPOSED | HIGH |
| [ADR-004](./ADR-004-integrate-dino.md) | [dino](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino) | Self-Supervised Vision | PROPOSED | HIGH |
| [ADR-005](./ADR-005-integrate-dinov2.md) | [dinov2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2) | Vision Foundation Model | PROPOSED | HIGH |
| [ADR-006](./ADR-006-integrate-gemma.md) | [gemma](https://github.com/google-deepmind/gemma) | Language Model | PROPOSED | HIGH |
| [ADR-007](./ADR-007-integrate-infinite-agentic-loop.md) | [infinite-agentic-loop](https://github.com/your-repo/infinite-agentic-loop) | Agentic System | PROPOSED | HIGH |

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Overview

### **Implementation Categories**
- **Agent Systems**: AutoGPT, infinite-agentic-loop
- **Foundation Models**: llama3, gemma  
- **Vision Models**: dino, dinov2
- **Automation**: skyvern

### **Integration Approach**
1. **Technical Analysis**: Use external-tools-research workflow for each repository
2. **Phased Implementation**: Implement in order of strategic priority and dependencies
3. **Risk Management**: Isolated integration environments and comprehensive testing
4. **Success Metrics**: Performance, functionality, and strategic value measurement

### **Resource Planning**
- **Development Time**: Estimated 2-4 weeks per repository
- **Priority Order**: Agent systems â†’ Automation â†’ Foundation models â†’ Vision models
- **Dependencies**: Consider inter-repository dependencies in implementation order

## ðŸ“Š Decision Summary

All 7 repositories received **IMPLEMENT** decisions based on:
- High strategic value (90%+ confidence)
- Strong LLM-first architecture alignment
- Clear integration opportunities with Kingly ecosystem
- Proven capabilities and mature codebases

## ðŸ”„ Process

These ADRs were generated through the Workshop LLM-First Intake System, which provides:
- Intelligent repository analysis with LLM assistance
- Human strategic decision points
- Systematic evaluation against Kingly architecture principles
- Clear action recommendations with confidence levels
