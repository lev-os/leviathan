## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Type**: Desktop Application Framework
**Technology**: Tauri 2, React, TypeScript, Rust
**Purpose**: GUI toolkit for Claude Code with visual session management, agent creation, and usage analytics
**Size**: Medium codebase with well-structured components
**Activity**: Active development, modern stack

## üìä STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT
**Strategic Value**: MAXIMUM - Fills critical UX gap in Leviathan ecosystem
**LLM-First Alignment**: 7/10 - GUI for LLM interactions, agent definitions, visual workflows
**Constitutional Compliance**: ‚úÖ All principles met

## üîç COMPARISON TO EXISTING SOLUTIONS
### Current Leviathan Desktop: Electron Service Dashboard
**What Claudia Does Better**:
- **Timeline/Checkpoint UI**: Visual branching history with diff viewer
- **Usage Analytics**: Token tracking, cost analysis with charts (Recharts)
- **Agent Builder UI**: Visual creation and management of CC agents
- **Session Management**: Beautiful project browser with search
- **Tauri 2 Performance**: Rust-based, smaller memory footprint
- **Modern UX**: Framer Motion animations, shadcn/ui components

**What Current Desktop Does Better**:
- Already integrated with Leviathan ecosystem
- Service management focused
- Electron allows easier Node.js integration

**Integration Opportunities**:
- Extract Claudia's UI components for Lev desktop migration
- Adapt CC agents format to generate Lev YAML definitions
- Use Timeline UI for Lev's session checkpoint system
- Analytics dashboard for bi-directional workflow monitoring
- Consider Tauri migration for performance benefits

## üîó INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES
‚Ä¢ **Timeline Navigator**: Perfect fit for Lev's session checkpoint/rollback system
‚Ä¢ **Usage Dashboard**: Addresses production monitoring gap with visual analytics
‚Ä¢ **Agent Creation UI**: Could generate Lev's YAML agent definitions
‚Ä¢ **MCP Server Management**: Visual interface for Lev's toolchain
‚Ä¢ **Checkpoint Diff Viewer**: Enhance Lev's session management
‚Ä¢ **Project Browser**: Better UX than CLI-only approach

## ‚ö° QUICK DECISION
**Decision**: EXTRACT PATTERNS
**Reasoning**: 
- User confirmed need for analytics and checkpoint system UI
- Planning to support more than Claude Code
- Existing Electron app can benefit from Tauri patterns
- Components are modular and extractable
**Timeline**: Immediate POC development
**Next Steps**: 
1. Create POC integrating Timeline and Analytics components
2. Evaluate Tauri vs Electron for performance
3. Adapt agent UI to output Lev YAML format
