  step_2_completed: true
  step_2_location: 'workshop/intake-mcp/memento-mcp/'
  step_3_completed: true
  step_3_findings:
    memory_system: 'Basic memory with graphiti_bridge, no temporal features'
    agent_capabilities: 'No version history or confidence decay'
    gaps_verified: 'Missing temporal awareness and sophisticated decay'

## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Type**: Knowledge Graph Memory System for LLMs  
**Technology**: Node.js, Neo4j, OpenAI embeddings, MCP protocol  
**Purpose**: Scalable knowledge graph memory with semantic retrieval, temporal awareness, and confidence decay  
**Size**: Comprehensive MCP server with advanced graph features  
**Activity**: Active development, well-maintained

## üìä STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT

**Strategic Value**: **MAXIMUM** - Solves critical temporal and confidence tracking gaps
**LLM-First Alignment**: 10/10 - Built specifically for LLM memory persistence
**Constitutional Compliance**: ‚úÖ Uses Neo4j like graphiti, clean architecture

## üîç COMPARISON TO EXISTING SOLUTIONS

### Current Best-in-Class: mcp-memory + mcp-graphiti

**What memento-mcp Does Better**:

- **Complete temporal solution** - Version history, point-in-time queries
- **Confidence decay** - Relations automatically decay over time
- **Unified Neo4j backend** - Vector search + graph in one database
- **Advanced metadata** - Source tracking, tags, structured data
- **Entity history tracking** - Full audit trail of changes
- **Time-based filtering** - Query graph state at any moment

**What Current Solutions Do Better**:

- mcp-memory: More memory-specific tools (23+)
- mcp-graphiti: Multi-project isolation built-in
- Both: Already being integrated

**Integration Opportunities**:

- Could replace both mcp-memory and mcp-graphiti
- Or use alongside for different memory types
- Extract temporal patterns for other systems

## üîó INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES

‚Ä¢ **Temporal Memory**: Add time-based memory queries to Leviathan
‚Ä¢ **Confidence Tracking**: Implement decay for uncertain information
‚Ä¢ **Version History**: Track how agent knowledge evolves
‚Ä¢ **Unified Backend**: Single Neo4j for all graph needs
‚Ä¢ **Advanced Search**: Semantic + temporal + confidence filters

## ‚ö° QUICK DECISION

**Decision**: MONITOR/EVALUATE
**Reasoning**: Excellent features but overlaps with mcp-memory + mcp-graphiti combo
**Timeline**: Evaluate after initial integrations (4-6 weeks)
**Next Steps**:

1. Complete mcp-memory + mcp-graphiti integration first
2. Evaluate if temporal features are still needed
3. Consider adopting if gaps remain
4. Or extract temporal patterns only

**STATUS**: Tier 1 (PRODUCTION-READY) - MONITOR/EVALUATE
