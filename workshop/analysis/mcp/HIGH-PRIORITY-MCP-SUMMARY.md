# üéØ HIGH-PRIORITY MCP SERVERS - INTAKE SUMMARY

_Analysis Date: 2025-06-25_  
_Analyzed: 6 MCP servers from workshop/intake-mcp/_

## üèÜ TOP RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. **mcp-memory** (ADOPT DEPENDENCY) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

- **Why**: Fills critical gap in memory persistence with 23+ specialized tools
- **Key Features**: Pattern learning, decay management, health dashboard, multiple transports
- **Integration**: Use as advanced backend for packages/memory
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

### 2. **mcp-agent** (EXTRACT PATTERNS) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

- **Why**: Implements ALL Building Effective Agents patterns we're missing
- **Key Features**: Orchestrator, Swarm, Evaluator-Optimizer, Router, Parallel workflows
- **Integration**: Port patterns to JavaScript for agent/src/workflows/
- **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks

### 3. **mcp-graphiti** (ADOPT DEPENDENCY) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

- **Why**: Temporal knowledge graphs complement vector search beautifully
- **Key Features**: Entity extraction, relationship tracking, time-based queries
- **Integration**: Enhance graphiti_bridge.py to use full MCP server
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

### 4. **mcp-use** (EXTRACT PATTERNS) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

- **Why**: Solves LLM flexibility - use any model, not just Anthropic
- **Key Features**: Multi-server coordination, dynamic selection, streaming
- **Integration**: Create JavaScript MCPClient with similar patterns
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

### 5. **memento-mcp** (MONITOR/EVALUATE) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

- **Why**: Complete temporal memory solution with confidence decay
- **Key Features**: Version history, point-in-time queries, confidence decay, unified Neo4j
- **Integration**: May replace mcp-memory + mcp-graphiti OR extract temporal patterns
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after initial integrations (4-6 weeks)

## üìä DECISION MATRIX

| Server       | Decision         | Strategic Value | LLM Alignment | Complexity |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| mcp-memory   | ADOPT            | MAXIMUM         | 9/10          | Low        |
| mcp-agent    | EXTRACT          | MAXIMUM         | 10/10         | Medium     |
| mcp-graphiti | ADOPT            | HIGH            | 8/10          | Medium     |
| mcp-use      | EXTRACT          | HIGH            | 9/10          | Low        |
| memento-mcp  | MONITOR/EVALUATE | MAXIMUM         | 10/10         | Medium     |

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### Week 1-2: Memory Foundation

1. **mcp-memory integration**

   - Test Docker deployment
   - Create MCP bridge in packages/memory
   - Map tools to Leviathan commands

2. **mcp-use patterns extraction**
   - Study MCPClient architecture
   - Create JS version with multi-server support

### Week 3-4: Agent Orchestration

3. **mcp-agent pattern porting**
   - Create agent/src/workflows/ structure
   - Implement Orchestrator pattern first
   - Add Evaluator-Optimizer for quality

### Week 5-6: Advanced Features

4. **mcp-graphiti integration**
   - Enhance graphiti_bridge.py
   - Create entity definitions
   - Implement temporal queries

## üîë KEY INSIGHTS

1. **Memory Gap**: We have basic memory but lack persistence, patterns, and decay management
2. **Orchestration Gap**: Limited to 3-tab coordination, need true multi-agent patterns
3. **LLM Lock-in**: Currently Anthropic-only, need flexibility for other providers
4. **Graph Memory**: Missing temporal relationships that graphiti provides

## üìã NEXT ACTIONS

1. **Immediate** (This week):

   - [ ] Set up mcp-memory Docker locally
   - [ ] Create test harness for MCP server integration
   - [ ] Start JavaScript MCPClient prototype

2. **Short-term** (Next 2 weeks):

   - [ ] Port first mcp-agent pattern (Orchestrator)
   - [ ] Integrate mcp-memory with packages/memory
   - [ ] Test multi-LLM support patterns

3. **Medium-term** (Month):
   - [ ] Complete all pattern extractions
   - [ ] Production deployment of memory servers
   - [ ] Full graphiti integration

## üé® ARCHITECTURAL IMPACT

These integrations will transform Leviathan's capabilities:

- **Persistent Memory**: From session-based to truly persistent
- **True Orchestration**: From job system to sophisticated multi-agent workflows
- **LLM Flexibility**: From Anthropic-only to any provider
- **Relationship Intelligence**: From flat memory to graph-based understanding

_Recommendation: Start with mcp-memory integration while studying mcp-agent patterns in parallel. These provide maximum value with reasonable complexity._
