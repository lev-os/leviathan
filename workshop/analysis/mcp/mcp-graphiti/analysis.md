## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Type**: MCP Server for Temporal Knowledge Graphs  
**Technology**: Python, FastMCP, Neo4j, Docker, Graphiti-core  
**Purpose**: Build per-project temporal knowledge graphs with entity extraction, relationship tracking, and time-based queries  
**Size**: Python server with CLI tools for multi-project management  
**Activity**: Fork of getzep/graphiti with multi-server enhancements

## üìä STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT

**Strategic Value**: **HIGH** - Adds sophisticated graph-based memory that complements vector search
**LLM-First Alignment**: 8/10 - Uses LLMs for entity extraction and relationship mapping
**Constitutional Compliance**: ‚úÖ Docker-based, clean separation, multi-project isolation

## üîç COMPARISON TO EXISTING SOLUTIONS

### Current Best-in-Class: packages/memory/graphiti_bridge.py

**What mcp-graphiti Does Better**:

- **Full temporal knowledge graphs** vs basic bridge
- **Multi-project isolation** with group_id namespacing
- **Entity relationship tracking** with facts and episodes
- **Time-based queries** - "what changed since X?"
- **Auto-generated Docker Compose** for easy deployment
- **Built-in entity extraction** via LLM analysis

**What Current System Does Better**:

- Direct integration without MCP overhead
- Simpler for basic memory needs
- Already has bridge started

**Integration Opportunities**:

- Enhance graphiti_bridge.py to use full MCP server
- Use for complex relationship tracking alongside vector memory
- Perfect for agent personality/preference modeling

## üîó INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES

‚Ä¢ **Enhanced Memory Backend**: Add as graph-based memory option
‚Ä¢ **Relationship Tracking**: Model agent-user interactions over time
‚Ä¢ **Project Knowledge Base**: Each project gets isolated knowledge graph
‚Ä¢ **Temporal Queries**: "What did user prefer last week vs now?"
‚Ä¢ **Entity Extraction**: Auto-discover entities from conversations

## ‚ö° QUICK DECISION

**Decision**: ADOPT DEPENDENCY
**Reasoning**: Provides missing temporal graph capabilities for advanced memory scenarios
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks (more complex than mcp-memory)
**Next Steps**:

1. Test multi-project Docker setup
2. Enhance graphiti_bridge.py to use MCP
3. Create entity definitions for Leviathan concepts
4. Implement temporal query patterns

**STATUS**: Tier 2 (ADVANCED-STABLE) - ADOPT DEPENDENCY
