Extracted from awesome-generative-ai repository analysis on 2025-06-28

## High Priority Agent Systems (Multi-Agent Orchestration)

1. **Auto-GPT** - https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT
   - Fully autonomous GPT-4 agent
   - Experimental attempt at full autonomy
   
2. **MetaGPT** - https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT
   - Multi-agent framework
   - Given one line requirement, returns PRD, design, tasks, repo
   
3. **AutoGen** - https://github.com/microsoft/autogen
   - Microsoft's framework for multi-agent conversations
   - Agents can converse to solve tasks
   
4. **babyagi** - https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi
   - AI-powered task management system
   - Could inform task decomposition patterns

5. **AgentGPT** - https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT

   - Configure and deploy agents in browser

## Secondary Priority (Specialized Patterns)

6. **GPT Engineer** - https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer
   - Builds entire projects from specifications
   - Could inform code generation patterns

7. **GPT Pilot** - https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot
   - Writes scalable apps while developer oversees
   - Production-oriented patterns

8. **OpenDevin** - https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin
