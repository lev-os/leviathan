## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Type**: Community Prompt Library
**Technology**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, community contribution system
**Purpose**: Structured collection of .clinerules & workflows for Cline AI assistant
**Size**: 19 prompt files in .clinerules/, workflows directory, community contribution system
**Activity**: Active community repository with structured contribution guidelines

## üìä STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT
**Strategic Value**: HIGH - Addresses complete gap in Leviathan ecosystem
**LLM-First Alignment**: 9/10 - Perfect alignment with prompt engineering and agent coordination
**Constitutional Compliance**: 
- ‚úÖ LLM-First Architecture (prompts as first-class citizens)
- ‚úÖ Maximum Extensibility (community-driven system)
- ‚úÖ Bi-Directional Communication (meta-learning protocols)
- ‚úÖ Bootstrap Sovereignty (self-contained prompt system)
- ‚úÖ Emergent Intelligence (community patterns emerge naturally)

## üîç COMPARISON TO EXISTING SOLUTIONS
### Current Best-in-Class: None (Complete Gap)
**What Cline Prompts Does Better**:
- Structured prompt library with metadata (description, author, version, tags)
- Community contribution system with clear guidelines
- Specialized patterns: Claude Code subagents, continuous improvement protocols
- Versioned prompts with glob pattern matching
- Multi-agent coordination via subprocess spawning
- Meta-learning and self-reflection protocols

**What Leviathan Currently Has**:
- Template evolution/sync tools (placeholder implementations only)
- Basic workflow execution system
- Memory management infrastructure
- MCP tool architecture

**Integration Opportunities**:
- Extract .clinerules format for .levrules system in @lev-os/prompts package
- Adapt community contribution patterns to Leviathan ecosystem
- Implement continuous improvement protocol for Leviathan agents
- Create prompt library management via MCP tools

## üîó INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES
‚Ä¢ **@lev-os/prompts Package**: Create structured prompt library with .levrules format
‚Ä¢ **Community Patterns**: Extract multi-agent coordination patterns for Leviathan
‚Ä¢ **Meta-Learning Integration**: Implement continuous improvement protocol for agent self-reflection
‚Ä¢ **MCP Prompt Tools**: Add prompt management to existing 18 MCP tools
‚Ä¢ **Template System Enhancement**: Replace placeholder implementations with real prompt management
‚Ä¢ **Memory Integration**: Connect prompt libraries to unified memory system

## ‚ö° QUICK DECISION
**Decision**: EXTRACT PATTERNS
**Reasoning**: Leviathan has ZERO prompt management infrastructure - this represents a complete missing capability that's essential for LLM-first architecture
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for initial @lev-os/prompts package with core patterns
**Next Steps**: 
1. Extract .clinerules format for .levrules specification
2. Design @lev-os/prompts package architecture
3. Implement community contribution system
4. Integrate with existing MCP tools and memory system

**STATUS**: Tier 1 (PRODUCTION-READY) - EXTRACT PATTERNS for immediate implementation
