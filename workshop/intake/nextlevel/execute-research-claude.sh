# Level 1 Stream 1: Agentic Architecture Intelligence
echo "🎯 Stream 1: Agentic Architecture Intelligence"

AGENTIC_PROMPT="Analyze the latest breakthrough patterns in multi-agent orchestration (2024-2025). Focus on: 
1) What specific architectural patterns are emerging beyond basic LLM chains? 
2) How are teams solving agent coordination, memory sharing, and state management? 
3) What performance bottlenecks are appearing at scale? 
4) Which approaches prioritize local control vs cloud orchestration? 
5) What are the actual production deployment patterns vs demos?

Include specific frameworks, but focus on underlying architectural principles that will persist beyond current tooling.

OUTPUT_FORMAT:
- Pattern Name
- Key Innovation  
- Architecture Impact
- Sovereignty Implications
- Speed/Performance Factors
- Production Readiness Score (1-10)"

# Level 1 Stream 2: Post-Agentic Paradigm Analysis
echo ""
echo "🤖 Stream 2: Post-Agentic Paradigm Analysis"

ROBOTICS_PROMPT="What comes after the current agentic AI wave? Research:
1) Embodied AI + robotics integration patterns - how are AI agents connecting to physical systems?
2) Brain-computer interfaces + AI orchestration - what's emerging in direct neural control?
3) Autonomous swarm intelligence - multi-robot coordination patterns
4) AI-native operating systems - what would an OS built for AI agents look like?
5) Post-human-in-the-loop workflows - fully autonomous business processes

Focus on technical patterns and sovereignty implications, not speculation.

OUTPUT_FORMAT:

echo "🔒 Stream 3: Hacker Sovereignty Movement"

HACKERS_PROMPT="Research the underground AI sovereignty movement. What are hackers and privacy-focused developers actually building?
1) Local-first AI orchestration projects that reject cloud dependencies
2) Decentralized agent networks and peer-to-peer AI coordination
3) Anti-surveillance AI tools and privacy-preserving agent architectures
4) Open-source alternatives to enterprise AI platforms
5) Mesh networks and edge AI coordination systems

Focus on GitHub projects with <1000 stars but high technical innovation. Include homelab and raspberry pi AI orchestration projects.

1) What are the specific lock-in mechanisms in current enterprise AI platforms?
2) How do performance characteristics differ between cloud-heavy vs local-first approaches?
3) What are the actual costs (performance, complexity, dependency) of framework-heavy solutions?
4) Where are enterprises hitting walls with vendor-dependent AI orchestration?
5) What patterns emerge from teams who've migrated away from complex AI frameworks?

Include specific case studies and performance benchmarks where available.
