Research the underground AI sovereignty movement. What are hackers and privacy-focused developers actually building?
1) Local-first AI orchestration projects that reject cloud dependencies
2) Decentralized agent networks and peer-to-peer AI coordination
3) Anti-surveillance AI tools and privacy-preserving agent architectures
4) Open-source alternatives to enterprise AI platforms
5) Mesh networks and edge AI coordination systems

Focus on GitHub projects with <1000 stars but high technical innovation. Include homelab and raspberry pi AI orchestration projects.

OUTPUT_FORMAT:
- Project Name
- Core Innovation
- Technical Architecture
- Sovereignty Score (1-10)
- Performance Characteristics  
- Community Size/Activity
- Kingly Alignment Potential
