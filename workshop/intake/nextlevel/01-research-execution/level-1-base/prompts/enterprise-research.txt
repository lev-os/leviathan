Analyze the emerging divide between enterprise AI platforms and sovereignty-focused solutions:
1) What are the specific lock-in mechanisms in current enterprise AI platforms?
2) How do performance characteristics differ between cloud-heavy vs local-first approaches?
3) What are the actual costs (performance, complexity, dependency) of framework-heavy solutions?
4) Where are enterprises hitting walls with vendor-dependent AI orchestration?
5) What patterns emerge from teams who've migrated away from complex AI frameworks?

Include specific case studies and performance benchmarks where available.

OUTPUT_FORMAT:
- Enterprise Platform
- Lock-in Mechanisms
- Performance Costs
- Migration Stories
