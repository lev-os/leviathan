What comes after the current agentic AI wave? Research:
1) Embodied AI + robotics integration patterns - how are AI agents connecting to physical systems?
2) Brain-computer interfaces + AI orchestration - what's emerging in direct neural control?
3) Autonomous swarm intelligence - multi-robot coordination patterns
4) AI-native operating systems - what would an OS built for AI agents look like?
5) Post-human-in-the-loop workflows - fully autonomous business processes

Focus on technical patterns and sovereignty implications, not speculation.

OUTPUT_FORMAT:
- Paradigm Name
- Technical Foundation
- Timeline to Viability
