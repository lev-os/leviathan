# BGPView

## Description
BGPView is a comprehensive BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) looking glass and routing intelligence platform that provides real-time and historical information about IP addresses, ASNs (Autonomous System Numbers), prefixes, and internet routing. It offers both a web interface and API for accessing global routing data.

## Key Features
- **IP Address Lookup**: Detailed information about any IP address
- **ASN Information**: Complete data about Autonomous Systems
- **Prefix Analysis**: Route origin and propagation information
- **Peering Relationships**: Visualize AS interconnections
- **Historical Data**: Track routing changes over time
- **IX Participation**: Internet Exchange membership data
- **Downstream/Upstream**: Identify network relationships
- **Free API Access**: No authentication required for basic queries
- **Global Coverage**: Data from multiple routing tables worldwide

## Use Cases
- **Network Troubleshooting**: Diagnose routing issues and anomalies
- **Security Research**: Identify BGP hijacking and route leaks
- **Asset Discovery**: Map organization's network infrastructure
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Analyze competitor network footprints
- **Incident Response**: Track routing changes during attacks
- **Due Diligence**: Research network assets for M&A
- **Network Planning**: Understand peering opportunities
- **Academic Research**: Study internet topology and evolution
