- **Threat Actor Tracking**: Monitor which groups target specific vulnerabilities
- **Exploit Availability**: Track proof-of-concept and weaponized exploits
- **Risk Scoring**: Proprietary algorithms for vulnerability prioritization
- **Dark Web Monitoring**: Intelligence from underground forums and markets
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast which vulnerabilities will be exploited
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with existing security tools
- **Natural Language Processing**: Extract insights from unstructured data
- **Global Coverage**: Multi-language threat intelligence

## Use Cases
- **Vulnerability Management**: Prioritize patching based on real-world risk
- **Threat Hunting**: Identify vulnerabilities actively exploited in the wild
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate exposure to emerging threats
- **Incident Response**: Understand attacker TTPs and vulnerabilities used
- **Strategic Planning**: Make informed decisions about security investments
- **Compliance**: Demonstrate proactive vulnerability management
- **Third-party Risk**: Monitor vulnerabilities in supply chain
- **Executive Reporting**: Provide context for security metrics

## Intelligence Sources
- **Technical Sources**: CVE databases, vendor advisories, security bulletins
- **Open Web**: Security blogs, forums, social media, news sites
- **Dark Web**: Underground forums, marketplaces, paste sites
