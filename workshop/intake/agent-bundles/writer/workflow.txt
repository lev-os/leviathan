Preliminary Report: WRITE Method - Writing Refined with Integrated Team Environment
Overview of BMAD Method
The BMAD Method (Breakthrough Method Agile-AI Driven-Development) is a structured workflow for software development that leverages AI personas in distinct phases to generate comprehensive documentation before development begins. The method follows a sequential approach:

Business Analyst (BA): Conducts market research and creates a Project Brief
Product Manager (PM): Transforms the Project Brief into a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD)
UX Expert: Refines UI/UX specifications based on the PRD
Architect: Creates a detailed technical architecture document
Product Owner (PO): Reviews and prioritizes stories
Scrum Master (SM): Creates detailed stories (not recommended in current form)
Developer: Works on one story at a time, creating a draft before implementation
This methodology emphasizes thorough documentation, clear role separation, and step-by-step progress tracking through a structured workflow.

Workflow Integration
The WRITE Method would follow this sequential workflow:

Writing Phase: Writer creates drafts based on research
Visual Development: Visual Content Specialist creates supporting visuals
Fact-Checking Phase: Fact Checker verifies accuracy and logic
Editing Phase: Editor refines and polishes content
Review Phase: Beta Readers provide audience perspective
Finalization Phase: Publication Specialist prepares for distribution
Each phase would have clear inputs, processes, and outputs documented in standardized templates.

Best Practices from Professional Authors and Publishers
Research into professional writing workflows reveals these key best practices:

Structured Brainstorming: Many authors use mind mapping or outlining techniques before beginning research
Research Documentation: Maintaining meticulous research notes with source attribution
Iterative Drafting: Most professional writers work through multiple drafts (3-5 typically)
Separation of Creation and Editing: Not editing while writing the first draft
Systematic Fact-Checking: Using a color-coded system to mark verified vs. unverified facts
Editorial Hierarchy: Following a specific sequence of editing (developmental → line → copy → proofing)
Version Control: Maintaining clear file naming and versioning
Collaborative Feedback: Structured feedback loops between roles
"Kill Your Darlings": Willingness to cut excellent but unnecessary content
Consistent Style: Adherence to style guides throughout the process

Next Steps
Define detailed templates for each phase of the WRITE Method
Create role-specific prompt templates for AI assistance
Develop a project management framework
Build a sample project using the WRITE Method
Test and refine the methodology
This preliminary report outlines the adaptation of the BMAD Method to create the WRITE Method for writers. The framework maintains the structured, role-based approach while tailoring it specifically to writing projects. In the next phase, we can further refine these roles and start developing detailed prompts for each.
