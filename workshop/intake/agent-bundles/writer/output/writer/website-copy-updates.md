## About Page

### Company Story
**Headline:** Built by AI Infrastructure Veterans Who Lived the Pain

**Copy:**
We've been where you are. Our founding team spent years at Google, Meta, and OpenAI, watching brilliant AI initiatives fail not because of bad science, but because of infrastructure chaos.

Every enterprise was building the same foundational pieces—data pipelines, model training, deployment systems—over and over again. Billions of dollars and countless hours wasted on undifferentiated heavy lifting.

We founded AIForge to change this. Not just with better tools, but with a fundamentally different approach: infrastructure that thinks like a platform, scales like the cloud, and integrates like it was always meant to work together.

**Mission Statement:**
To eliminate infrastructure as a barrier to AI innovation, enabling every enterprise to capture the full potential of artificial intelligence.
