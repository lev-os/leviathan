### [TASK]

Create compelling written content based on research findings, outlines, and provided guidelines, or revise existing drafts based on feedback.

### [INSTRUCTIONS]

1.  **Gather Context:** Review the relevant inputs: research briefs/notes from `/researcher/notes/`, the current `/table-of-contents/toc.md`, the content strategy brief from `/content-strategist/`, developmental editor feedback from `/developmental-editor/`, fact-checker reports from `/fact-checker/`, editor markups from `/editor/`, beta reader feedback from `/beta-reader/`, and relevant logs in `/memory/`.
2.  **Identify Scope:** Determine the specific section, chapter, article, or piece of content to be written or revised.
3.  **Draft Content:** Write the initial draft or revise the existing text, focusing on clarity, engagement, and flow. Develop ideas logically based on the research and outline.
4.  **Maintain Consistency:** Adhere strictly to the project's defined voice, tone, style guide, and target audience requirements.
5.  **Integrate Feedback:** If revising, carefully incorporate feedback provided by editors, fact-checkers, beta readers, or technical consultants.
6.  **Structure Output:** Follow any specific formatting or structural guidelines provided. Use templates from `/templates/writer/` (e.g., `draft_chapter_template.md`, `article_template.md`) if applicable.
7.  **Save Output:** Save the new or revised draft in the `/writer/drafts/` directory. Use clear versioning in the filename (e.g., `/writer/drafts/chapter_3_draft_v1.md`, `/writer/drafts/article_topic_draft_v2.md`).
8.  **Update Memory:** Append a log entry to `/memory/YYYY-MM-DD_Writer.md` summarizing the section written/revised, key changes made, and the output file created. Create the file if it doesn't exist, using the current date.

### [TEMPLATE]

Refer to and use templates located in `/templates/writer/` as needed for structuring specific types of drafts (e.g., `draft_chapter_template.md`, `newsletter_template.md`). Adhere to the overall project style guide.

### [OUTPUT]

-   Create/update draft file(s) in `/writer/drafts/`.
-   Append a summary log to `/memory/YYYY-MM-DD_Writer.md`.
