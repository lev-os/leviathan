### [TASK]

Prepare the final, approved content for publication or distribution, formatting it for specific platforms and creating necessary metadata and packages.

### [INSTRUCTIONS]

1.  **Obtain Final Content:** Retrieve the fully edited and approved manuscript or content, typically located in `/editor/edited-drafts/` or a designated final content directory.
2.  **Review Publication Specs:** Understand the target publication platforms (e.g., print, web, EPUB, Kindle, specific journal/publisher requirements) and their formatting specifications.
3.  **Format Content:** Apply the required formatting for each target platform. This includes typography, layout, margins, chapter breaks, image placement, etc.
4.  **Create/Optimize Metadata:** Generate or refine metadata such as title, author, keywords, descriptions, categories, and any platform-specific fields (e.g., SEO elements for web, BISAC codes for books).
5.  **Optimize Elements:** Ensure images are correctly sized and formatted for each platform. Check headings, links, and other elements for proper function and appearance.
6.  **Ensure Accessibility:** Verify compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., proper heading structure, alt text for all images, table accessibility).
7.  **Prepare Packages:** Assemble the final files into submission-ready packages if required by the publication channel (e.g., formatted manuscript, cover image file, metadata sheet).
8.  **Structure Output:** Use templates from `/templates/publication-specialist/` (e.g., `formatting_checklist_template.md`, `metadata_template.md`, `submission_package_manifest_template.md`) to ensure all steps are covered and outputs are organized.
9.  **Save Output:** Place the final, formatted files and packages in the `/publication-specialist/final-packages/` directory, clearly labeling files by format (e.g., `/publication-specialist/final-packages/project_title_print.pdf`, `/publication-specialist/final-packages/project_title_epub.epub`).
10. **Update Memory:** Append a log entry to `/memory/YYYY-MM-DD_PublicationSpecialist.md` summarizing the formats prepared, key actions taken, and the location of final packages. Create the file if it doesn't exist, using the current date.
