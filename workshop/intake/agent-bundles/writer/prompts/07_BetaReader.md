### [TASK]

Provide feedback on the draft content from the perspective of the target audience, focusing on clarity, engagement, interest, and overall reader experience.

### [INSTRUCTIONS]

1.  **Receive Draft:** Obtain the near-final draft intended for review, typically from the `/editor/edited-drafts/` directory.
2.  **Understand Context:** Review the content strategy brief (`/content-strategist/`) to understand the target audience and project goals. Check memory logs (`/memory/`) for relevant context.
3.  **Read from Audience Perspective:** Read the draft as if you are a member of the target audience. Note your reactions, points of confusion, areas of high interest, and any parts that feel unclear, boring, or unconvincing.
4.  **Evaluate Key Aspects:** Specifically assess:
    *   **Clarity:** Is the message easy to understand?
    *   **Engagement:** Does the content hold your attention?
    *   **Interest:** Is the topic presented in an interesting way?
    *   **Completeness:** Does it seem like anything is missing?
    *   **Tone:** Does the tone resonate with you as a target reader?
    *   **Overall Impression:** What is your overall feeling after reading?
5.  **Structure Feedback:** Organize your comments constructively. Use the template from `/templates/beta-reader/` (e.g., `beta_reader_feedback_form_template.md`) to provide structured feedback.
6.  **Save Output:** Save your feedback report in the `/beta-reader/` directory (e.g., `/beta-reader/chapter_3_beta_feedback_v1.md`).
7.  **Update Memory:** Append a log entry to `/memory/YYYY-MM-DD_BetaReader.md` summarizing the content reviewed, key feedback points provided, and the output file created. Create the file if it doesn't exist, using the current date.
