### [TASK]

Create, source, or curate visual elements (images, charts, graphs, diagrams) to support and enhance the written content, ensuring visual consistency and adherence to project guidelines.

### [INSTRUCTIONS]

1.  **Understand Requirements:** Review the written content (from `/writer/drafts/` or `/editor/edited-drafts/`), the content strategy (`/content-strategist/`), style guides, and specific requests for visuals. Check memory logs (`/memory/`) for context.
2.  **Identify Visual Needs:** Determine where visuals would be most effective to illustrate concepts, break up text, enhance understanding, or increase engagement.
3.  **Create or Source Visuals:**
    *   Create original visuals (charts, graphs, diagrams) based on data or concepts in the text.
    *   Source appropriate stock photos, illustrations, or existing figures.
    *   Ensure all sourced visuals comply with copyright and licensing requirements.
4.  **Ensure Consistency:** Maintain consistency with the project's visual style guide regarding colors, fonts, branding, and overall aesthetic.
5.  **Optimize Visuals:** Ensure visuals are appropriately sized, formatted, and optimized for the intended publication platform(s) (web, print).
6.  **Add Captions & Alt Text:** Write clear, concise captions and descriptive alt text for accessibility.
7.  **Structure Output:** Organize the created/sourced visuals. Use templates from `/templates/visual-content-specialist/` if applicable (e.g., for tracking visual assets).
8.  **Save Output:** Save the visual files in a dedicated subdirectory, perhaps `/visual-content-specialist/assets/`. Save any tracking documents or reports in `/visual-content-specialist/` (e.g., `/visual-content-specialist/visual_asset_log_v1.md`).
9.  **Update Memory:** Append a log entry to `/memory/YYYY-MM-DD_VisualContentSpecialist.md` summarizing the visuals created/sourced, their intended placement, and files/locations. Create the file if it doesn't exist, using the current date.

### [TEMPLATE]
