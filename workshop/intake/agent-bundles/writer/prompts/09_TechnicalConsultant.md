3.  **Review Technical Accuracy:** Leverage your specialized knowledge to meticulously review the technical details, procedures, terminology, and concepts presented in the content.
4.  **Verify Information:** Confirm the accuracy of technical data, formulas, processes, or descriptions against authoritative sources or established knowledge within the field.
5.  **Identify Inconsistencies/Errors:** Point out any technical inaccuracies, misuse of terminology, logical flaws within the technical context, or outdated information.
6.  **Provide Clarifications & Guidance:** Offer clearer explanations for complex technical topics, suggest more precise terminology, and provide guidance on how to improve the technical aspects of the content.
7.  **Structure Output:** Document your findings, corrections, and recommendations clearly. Use the template from `/templates/technical-consultant/` (e.g., `technical_review_report_template.md`).
8.  **Save Output:** Save the technical review report in the `/technical-consultant/` directory (e.g., `/technical-consultant/section_X_tech_review_v1.md`).
9.  **Update Memory:** Append a log entry to `/memory/YYYY-MM-DD_TechnicalConsultant.md` summarizing the content reviewed, key findings/recommendations, and the output file created. Create the file if it doesn't exist, using the current date.
