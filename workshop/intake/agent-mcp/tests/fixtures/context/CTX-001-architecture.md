Task: TASK-001 - Implement secure wallet manager  
Type: architecture  
Created: 2025-01-15T10:00:00.000Z

## Summary
Design a secure cryptocurrency wallet system with multi-signature support and hardware wallet integration.

## Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and PostgreSQL
- **Blockchain**: Web3.js for Ethereum, additional libraries for other chains
- **Security**: Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration

## Key Components
1. **Wallet Core**: Private key management and signing
2. **Multi-sig Manager**: Coordinate multi-signature transactions
3. **Hardware Integration**: Ledger/Trezor support
4. **Transaction Pool**: Manage pending transactions
5. **Security Layer**: Encryption and access controls

## Security Decisions
- Private keys never stored in plain text
- All transactions require explicit user approval
- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Technical Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with encryption at rest
- **Caching**: Redis for session management
- **API**: GraphQL for flexible queries
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live updates
