- Meta-learning to determine optimal workflow selection over time

## Next Steps

1. **Prototype Selection**: Choose 2-3 workflows for initial implementation
2. **Agent Capability Mapping**: Define which existing agents support which workflows
3. **Workflow Orchestrator**: Build meta-system to select and manage workflows
4. **Testing Framework**: Create evaluation metrics for workflow effectiveness
5. **Iterative Development**: Start simple, add complexity based on performance data
