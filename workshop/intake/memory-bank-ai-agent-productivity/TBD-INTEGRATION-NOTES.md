# Memory Bank Integration Notes (TBD - Pending Consolidation)

## Status: TBD until documentation consolidation completes

**Date**: 2025-06-24
**Analysis**: Memory Bank pattern identified as procedural memory for AI context persistence

## Key Integration Points (To Be Addressed)

### 1. Memory Bank = Procedural Memory Patterns
- Memory Bank's 6-file structure maps to procedural memory templates
- Should integrate as YAML patterns in `procedural_patterns/` directory
- Focus: AI agent session continuity and project context

### 2. Cascading Context Integration
- **Workspace Level**: Memory bank for workspace-wide context
- **Project Level**: Memory bank for project-specific context  
- **Folder Level**: Minimal/none (respects folder philosophy)
- Needs to support "any PM structure" requirement

### 3. Enhanced File-Only Fallback
When Graphiti unavailable:
- Memory Bank provides structured file-based context
- Pre-indexed markdown files for fast AI consumption
- Graceful degradation with same functionality

### 4. Integration with Existing Systems
- Memory Bank files complement existing `context.yaml` structure
- Procedural memory already handles pattern storage in YAML
- Memory Bank adds AI-specific context persistence patterns

## Proposed Architecture (Subject to Consolidation)

```yaml
# Procedural Memory Templates
procedural_patterns/
├── memory-bank/
│   ├── project-brief.yaml      # Template for project overview
│   ├── product-context.yaml    # Template for why project exists
│   ├── active-context.yaml     # Template for current work
│   ├── system-patterns.yaml    # Template for architecture
│   ├── tech-context.yaml       # Template for tech stack
│   └── progress.yaml           # Template for status tracking

# Generated Memory Banks
.kingly/memory-bank/
├── workspace/                  # Workspace-level memory
├── projects/                   # Project-specific memory
└── sessions/                   # Session continuity
```

## Questions for Consolidation

1. How do Memory Bank patterns integrate with existing procedural memory?
2. Should each context level have its own memory bank structure?
3. What's the relationship between Memory Bank and context.yaml?
4. How does personal → team → planetary scaling work with cascading contexts?
5. Should Memory Bank be auto-generated from existing context files?

## Implementation Suggestions (Post-Consolidation)

1. **Procedural Memory Templates**: Create Memory Bank as reusable patterns
2. **Context-Aware Generation**: Respect workspace/project hierarchy
3. **Graphiti Sync**: Memory Bank files as seed data for graph construction
4. **Human-Readable**: Maintain markdown format for debugging/understanding
5. **Git-Friendly**: Enable team collaboration through version control

## Next Steps

1. Wait for documentation consolidation to complete
2. Review final ADRs on memory architecture
3. Implement Memory Bank as procedural memory patterns
4. Test with existing cascading context system
5. Document in consolidated architecture guide
