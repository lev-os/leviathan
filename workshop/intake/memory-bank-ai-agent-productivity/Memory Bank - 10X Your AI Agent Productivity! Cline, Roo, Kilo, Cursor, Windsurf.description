In this video, I will explain how memory bank works, as well as show you how to get started in Cline and Cursor. Enjoy.

Note that memory bank is not a Cline or Cursor specific feature, but rather a set of methodologies that can be implemented in any code editor that support custom rules. You can apply the same method in Roo Code, Kilo Code, and Windsurf as well.
