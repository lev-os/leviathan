# Leviathan Integration

When Leviathan MCP is available:

- Auto-discover lev commands on session start
- Initialize with `lev_checkpoint`
- Use `lev_find` for workflow discovery

Natural language → Leviathan mapping:

- "find workflow" → `lev_find`
- "checkpoint" → `lev_checkpoint`
- "handoff" → `lev_handoff`

Present workflows with quick codes (1a-3z)
