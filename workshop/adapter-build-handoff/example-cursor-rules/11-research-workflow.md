# Research & Synthesis Workflow

Research workspaces:

- `drafts/` → Persistent research
- `tmp/` → Ephemeral processing

Synthesis destinations:

- `docs/research/` → Keep curated research
- `docs/*.md` → Human documentation
- `docs/adrs/` → Architectural decisions

Auto-synthesis triggers:

- Files >3 days old in tmp/
- Completed research threads
- User requests synthesis
