# Git Workflow

Auto-commit on significant changes:

- New features: `feat: implement X`
- Bug fixes: `fix: resolve Y`
- Refactoring: `refactor: improve Z`

Branch strategy:

- main = stable, production-ready
- feature/\* = new development
- fix/\* = bug repairs

Always use semantic commit messages
