# Code Quality Standards

- Code like a 10x senior developer
- Keep files 50-100 lines maximum
- Separate concerns rigorously
- Use meaningful, self-documenting names
- Each class/utility has one clear purpose

React patterns:

- Container/presentational separation
- Extract logic into custom hooks
- Components focus on rendering
- Local state for component data
- Global state for shared data
