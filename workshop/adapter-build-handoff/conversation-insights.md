# Adapter Build System - Conversation Insights

## üîç Key Discoveries

### 1. The Universal Context Vision

- **~/c** (FlowMind) = Central source of truth for all AI contexts
- **~/lev** = Platform-specific adapter implementations
- **Build Process** = Transforms universal contexts ‚Üí optimized adapters

### 2. Architecture Pattern Identified

```
Universal Contexts (YAML/MD)
       ‚Üì
   Build System
       ‚Üì
Platform Adapters (Optimized)
```

### 3. Current State Analysis

#### What Works Well

- `.cursor/prompts/intake.md` - Good example of adapted workflow
- Modular rule structure in `.cursor/global-rules/`
- Clear command mappings (natural language ‚Üí CLI)

#### What's Missing

- No automated build process
- Manual copying/adaptation required
- No versioning between ~/c and adapters
- No platform-specific optimizations

### 4. The "Adapter as Software" Insight

- Prompts should be treated as **versioned, buildable, distributable software artifacts**
- Each platform needs optimization (token limits, formatting, capabilities)
- Build process ensures consistency across platforms

### 5. Integration Points Discovered

#### Leviathan Core

- **Command Registry** - Auto-register commands from contexts
- **Plugin System** - Adapters as plugins
- **Memory Package** - Dynamic context storage/retrieval
- **MCP Protocol** - Universal communication

#### FlowMind Contexts

- **Patterns** - Single-focus frameworks
- **Workflows** - Multi-step processes
- **Agents** - AI personalities
- **Themes** - Visual/interaction styles

### 6. Platform-Specific Needs

#### Claude Code (Cursor)

- Needs `.cursor/rules/` structure
- Prefers markdown format
- Benefits from semantic triggers
- Natural language ‚Üí CLI mapping

#### Gemini CLI

- Different token limits
- May need different formatting
- CLI-first interaction model
- Direct command execution

### 7. Build System Requirements

- **Hot reload** for development
- **Platform templates** for new adapters
- **Transformation pipeline** for content
- **Validation** of generated adapters
- **Extensibility** for new platforms

## üí° Critical Realizations

1. **Composite Adapter Pattern** - Some platforms (Claude Code) use other adapters (MCP)
2. **YAML-First Philosophy** - Aligns with Leviathan's configuration-driven approach
3. **LLM-First Reasoning** - Don't pattern match, use AI reasoning
4. **Every IDE is an Entry Point** - Each coding assistant is a gateway to the system

## üéØ Strategic Decisions

1. **Start with Claude Code** - Most mature integration
2. **Gemini CLI as Second** - Tests different interaction model
3. **Core Package Approach** - Full system access for adapter builder
4. **Maintain ~/c Independence** - FlowMind remains platform-agnostic

## üìä Success Metrics Defined

- Zero duplication between platforms
- Automatic propagation of changes
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Simple developer experience
- Community extensibility

_These insights led to the decision to create `@lev-os/adapter-builder` as a core package that bridges the universal context system with platform-specific implementations._
