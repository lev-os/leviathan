# WORKSHOP INTELLIGENCE MASTER PLAN
*Generated: 2025-06-13*
*Session: kingly-core-agent-session-20250613*

## 🎯 MISSION: Transform Workshop into Complete Tool Intelligence Package

### Executive Summary
Transform the existing workshop (170+ tools, 43 directories) into `@kingly/workshop-intelligence` package with standardized tool intake processes, semantic tier classification, and systematic evaluation workflows.

## 🏗️ TIER CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

### Numerical → Semantic Mapping

| Tier | Semantic Name | Description | Integration Timeline | Examples |
|------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Tier 1** | **PRODUCTION-READY** | Battle-tested, immediate integration | 1-2 weeks | Ultimate MCP Server, Claude Task Master |
| **Tier 2** | **ADVANCED-STABLE** | Proven but requires adaptation | 2-4 weeks | CrewAI, Graphiti Memory, AutoGen |
| **Tier 3** | **EMERGING-VIABLE** | Promising with good documentation | 3-6 weeks | Multi-Agent RAG, Swarm Patterns |
| **Tier 4** | **RESEARCH-READY** | Solid proof-of-concept | 4-8 weeks | TensorZero, Novel RAG approaches |
| **Tier 5** | **EXPERIMENTAL-PROMISING** | Early stage but interesting | 6-12 weeks | Advanced voice synthesis, Vision processing |
| **Tier 6** | **PROTOTYPE-STAGE** | Working demos, needs refinement | 8-16 weeks | Research frameworks, Custom architectures |
| **Tier 7** | **CONCEPT-PROOF** | Academic/research implementations | 12+ weeks | Theoretical frameworks, Academic research |
| **Tier 8** | **EXPLORATORY** | Ideas and early experiments | Research only | Cutting-edge research, Speculative systems |
