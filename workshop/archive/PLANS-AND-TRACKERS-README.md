## üéØ How to Use Each Tracker

### TRACKER.csv - Tool Evaluation Progress
**Purpose**: Track evaluation and classification of all 170+ workshop tools

**Columns**:
- `Project`: Tool/project name
- `Directory`: Location in workshop
- `Current_Tier_Numeric`: Original numerical tier (1-8)
- `Semantic_Tier`: New semantic classification (PRODUCTION-READY, etc.)
- `LLM_First_Score`: LLM-first architecture compatibility (0.0-1.0)
- `Sovereignty_Score`: Independence and control rating (0.0-1.0)
- `Integration_Complexity`: Development effort required (0.0-1.0)
- `Strategic_Value`: Business impact potential (0.0-1.0)
- `Weighted_Score`: Calculated overall score
- `Decision`: adopt_immediately, adapt_and_integrate, research_only, reject
- `Timeline_Weeks`: Expected integration timeline
- `Status`: ready, pending, completed
- `Notes`: Additional context and observations

**Usage**:
```bash
# View all production-ready tools
grep "PRODUCTION-READY" TRACKER.csv

# Find tools pending evaluation
grep "pending" TRACKER.csv

# Get tools by integration timeline
awk -F',' '$11 <= 4 {print $1, $4, $11}' TRACKER.csv
```

### IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER.csv - Task Progress
**Purpose**: Track execution of the workshop transformation plan

**Columns**:
- `Phase`: Implementation phase (Phase_1, Phase_2, etc.)
- `Task_ID`: Unique task identifier (P1T1, P2T3, etc.)
- `Task_Name`: Short task description
- `Description`: Detailed task explanation
- `Timeline`: Estimated completion time
- `Dependencies`: Other tasks that must complete first
- `Status`: pending, in_progress, completed, blocked
- `Priority`: high, medium, low
- `Assignee`: Who is responsible (if applicable)
- `Notes`: Additional context and observations
- `Deliverable`: Expected output/artifact

**Usage**:
```bash
# View current phase tasks
grep "Phase_1" IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER.csv

# Find high priority pending tasks
awk -F',' '$7=="pending" && $8=="high" {print $3, $5}' IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER.csv

# Check task dependencies
grep "P2T1" IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER.csv
```

## üöÄ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Simple Restructure (1 hour total)
**Objective**: Clean up directory structure and prepare infrastructure
- Move docs/workshop ‚Üí workshop/docs
- Create intake/ directory structure
- Set up package.json and CLI framework

### Phase 2: Intake Implementation (1 week total)
**Objective**: Build complete evaluation and integration system
- Create evaluation framework for all tiers
- Build tier-specific integration patterns
- Implement CLI commands (evaluate, integrate, classify)

### Phase 3: Tool Classification (2 weeks total)
**Objective**: Process all 170+ tools through new system
- Validate framework with known tools
- Batch process all tools
- Generate strategic integration roadmap

### Phase 4: Real-World Testing (1 week total)
**Objective**: Validate system with new tools (ACI, Perplexity)
- Test complete intake process
- Refine based on real usage
- Document best practices

## üìà Progress Monitoring

### Quick Status Check
```bash
# Overall progress by phase
awk -F',' 'NR>1 {count[$1]++; if($7=="completed") done[$1]++} END {for(p in count) print p": "done[p]"/"count[p]}' IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKER.csv

# Tool evaluation completion
awk -F',' 'NR>1 {total++; if($13=="ready"||$13=="completed") done++} END {print "Tools: "done"/"total}' TRACKER.csv
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Phase Completion**: % of tasks completed per phase
- **Tool Classification**: % of tools evaluated and classified
- **High Priority Tasks**: Number of pending high-priority items
- **CLI Functionality**: Number of working CLI commands
- **Integration Readiness**: Number of tools ready for integration

## üîÑ Maintenance and Updates

### Daily Updates
