# Workshop Repository Intake Process - MANDATORY 6-STEP SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: You MUST complete ALL 6 steps IN ORDER. No skipping allowed.
‚ö†Ô∏è **FAILURE WARNING**: Previous agents failed by skipping Step 3 (Lev system scan).

## ü§ù INTERACTIVE MODE DETECTION

<mode_selection>
IF working with human in real-time: Use Interactive Mode
IF autonomous execution: Use Standard Mode
IF multiple repositories: Use Batch Mode
</mode_selection>

### Interactive Mode Requirements:
- Share findings after each step before proceeding
- Ask for guidance on ambiguous decisions  
- Confirm cleanup actions before execution
- Never auto-delete without explicit permission

### Interactive Mode Checkpoints:
- **After Step 1**: "Found [X] in cache. Should I proceed with acquisition?"
- **After Step 2**: "Content saved to [location]. Structure verified. Ready for Lev scan?"
- **After Step 3**: "Lev capabilities: [findings]. Which areas need deeper investigation?"
- **Before Step 5**: "I recommend [DECISION] because [REASONING]. Your thoughts?"
- **Before Step 6**: "Documentation path: ADR via wizard experience OR POC first?"

### Batch Mode Process:
**Phase 1: Parallel Acquisition**
```bash
# Clone all repositories in parallel
git clone <repo1_url> ~/lev/workshop/intake/<repo1_name> &
git clone <repo2_url> ~/lev/workshop/intake/<repo2_name> &
git clone <repo3_url> ~/lev/workshop/intake/<repo3_name> &
wait
```

**Phase 2: Shared Analysis (Once)**
- Step 1: Load cache once, reuse for all repos
- Step 3: Scan Lev capabilities once, cache findings

**Phase 3: Per-Repository Processing**
- Steps 2,4,5,6 per repository using cached data
- Generate cross-repository comparison matrix

**Efficiency**: Reduces operations from 6√óN to 3+3√óN (~40-60% time savings)

## ‚ùå FAILURE PATTERNS (What NOT to do):
1. **Skipping Step 3**: "I'll just assume what Leviathan has" ‚Üí WRONG
2. **Assuming gaps**: "Leviathan probably doesn't have X" ‚Üí WRONG
3. **Surface analysis**: "The README says it does memory" ‚Üí INSUFFICIENT
4. **Speed over accuracy**: "I'll do a quick scan" ‚Üí WRONG

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS PATTERNS (What TO do):
1. **Complete Step 3**: Actually read ~/lev/packages/memory/ code
2. **Evidence-based gaps**: "I checked memory/ and it lacks X" ‚Üí CORRECT
3. **Deep code analysis**: "The implementation in src/ shows Y" ‚Üí CORRECT
4. **Thorough comparison**: "Lev has A,B,C but this adds D,E" ‚Üí CORRECT## üìã STEP 1: Scan Cache
**‚ö†Ô∏è STOP**: Do not proceed until you have:
- [ ] Loaded cache/leviathan-capability-matrix.yaml
- [ ] Listed all "current best-in-class" solutions
- [ ] Noted comparison baselines for this repo type

**Checkpoint 1**: Document findings in working memory before proceeding.

### Interactive Mode Checkpoint:
"üìã **Step 1 Complete**: Found [X] in cache. Current best solutions: [Y]. 
Should I proceed with acquisition?"

## üìã STEP 2: Source Acquisition / Verification

### Content Acquisition Routes

<content_routing>
TYPE: GitHub Repository
  ACTION: git clone <url> ~/lev/workshop/intake/<repo_name>
  
  <example>
  URL: https://github.com/evalstate/fast-agent
  CORRECT: git clone https://github.com/evalstate/fast-agent ~/lev/workshop/intake/fast-agent
  VERIFY: ls ~/lev/workshop/intake/fast-agent/
  </example>

TYPE: Article/Documentation
  ACTION: Create directory, then save content
  
  <example>
  URL: https://fast-agent.ai/agents/defining/
  STEP 1: mkdir ~/lev/workshop/intake/fast-agent
  STEP 2: Save content to ~/lev/workshop/intake/fast-agent/article.md
  VERIFY: ls ~/lev/workshop/intake/fast-agent/
  </example>

TYPE: Multiple Sources Same Project
  <example>
  Sources: Article + GitHub repo for same project
  STRUCTURE:
    ~/lev/workshop/intake/fast-agent/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ article.md          # Documentation content
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repo/              # OR direct clone in main folder
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other sources]    # transcript.md, etc.
  </example>
</content_routing>

### MANDATORY Directory Structure Verification:
```bash
# REQUIRED after every save operation:
ls ~/lev/workshop/intake/[project-name]/
```

### FAILURE PREVENTION CHECKLIST:
‚ùå **NEVER DO:**
- Save files directly in ~/lev/workshop/intake/ 
- Use custom filenames like "project-docs.md"
- Skip directory creation step
- Skip ls verification

‚úÖ **ALWAYS DO:**
- Create project subdirectory FIRST
- Use standard names: article.md, transcript.md
- Verify structure with ls command
- Show ls output before proceeding

**‚ö†Ô∏è STOP**: Do not proceed until you have:
- [ ] Located source in ~/lev/workshop/intake/[name]/
  - GitHub: Cloned repository
  - Other: Pre-saved content ([name]/transcript.md, [name]/article.md, etc.)
- [ ] Verified with `ls ~/lev/workshop/intake/[name]/`
- [ ] For large repos (20+ components): Documented sampling strategy

**Checkpoint 2**: Source location confirmed in working memory.

### Interactive Mode Checkpoint:
"üìã **Step 2 Complete**: Content saved to [location]. Structure verified:
[show ls output]
Ready for Lev system scan?"

## üìã STEP 3: Scan Actual Lev Paths ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP
**‚ö†Ô∏è STOP**: This is the MOST SKIPPED and MOST IMPORTANT step!

**MANDATORY SCANS**:
```bash
# 1. Memory System - What do we ACTUALLY have?
ls ~/lev/packages/memory/
cat ~/lev/packages/memory/README.md
# Check actual implementation files

# 2. Agent System - What are our ACTUAL capabilities?
ls ~/lev/agent/src/
cat ~/lev/agent/src/commands/
# Check our 18 MCP tools

# 3. Plugins - What patterns exist?
ls ~/lev/plugins/
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT ASSUME**: Read the actual code to understand capabilities!

**Checkpoint 3**: Document ACTUAL findings with file references.

### Interactive Mode Checkpoint:
"üìã **Step 3 Complete**: Lev capabilities analyzed:
- Memory system: [specific findings with file references]
- Agent capabilities: [specific findings with file references] 
- Verified gaps: [evidence-based gaps only]
Which areas need deeper investigation?"

## üìã STEP 4: Comprehensive Evaluation
**‚ö†Ô∏è STOP**: Do not proceed until you have:
- [ ] Compared against ACTUAL Lev capabilities from Step 3
- [ ] Identified VERIFIED gaps (not assumed)
- [ ] Created comparison matrix
- [ ] For large repos: Analyzed 3-5 representative examples

**Checkpoint 4**: Complete analysis with evidence-based comparisons.

### Interactive Mode Checkpoint:
"üìã **Step 4 Complete**: Analysis reveals:
- Repository strengths: [specific capabilities]
- Lev vs Repository comparison: [evidence-based comparison]
- Integration opportunities: [specific possibilities]
Which aspects interest you most for potential integration?"

## üìã STEP 5: Decision Implementation & Post-Processing
**‚ö†Ô∏è STOP**: Do not proceed until you have:
- [ ] Made decision: EXTRACT/ADOPT/FORK/MONITOR/PASS
- [ ] Executed the corresponding action:

**Decision ‚Üí Action Checklist**:
- [ ] **EXTRACT PATTERNS**: `mv ~/lev/workshop/intake/[name] ~/lev/_ref/`
- [ ] **ADOPT DEPENDENCY**: Install with pnpm, then `rm -rf ~/lev/workshop/intake/[name]`
- [ ] **FORK/MODIFY**: `mv ~/lev/workshop/intake/[name] ~/lev/vendor/` (or ~/lev/os/vendor/)
- [ ] **MONITOR**: `rm -rf ~/lev/workshop/intake/[name]` (keep analysis only)
- [ ] **PASS**: `rm -rf ~/lev/workshop/intake/[name]` (not useful)

### Post-Decision Processing Routes

**CRITICAL UPDATE**: Repository destination depends on implementation readiness:

#### 1. **workshop/approved/** - Further Analysis Required
- **When**: EXTRACT/ADOPT/FORK decisions that need integration planning
- **Purpose**: Staging area for approved technologies awaiting implementation
- **Contents**: Repos that passed intake but need ADR/POC before _ref
- **Action**: `mv ~/lev/workshop/intake/[name] ~/lev/workshop/approved/`

#### 2. **_ref/** - Shovel Ready
- **When**: Patterns ready for immediate extraction/use
- **Purpose**: Reference implementations ready to copy/integrate
- **Contents**: Clean, documented patterns ready for direct use
- **Action**: `mv ~/lev/workshop/approved/[name] ~/lev/_ref/`

#### 3. **Direct Deletion** - No Further Value
- **When**: MONITOR/PASS decisions
- **Purpose**: Keep workspace clean
- **Action**: `rm -rf ~/lev/workshop/intake/[name]`

**Updated Decision Matrix**:
- [ ] **EXTRACT PATTERNS**: ‚Üí `workshop/approved/` ‚Üí ADR ‚Üí `_ref/`
- [ ] **ADOPT DEPENDENCY**: ‚Üí `workshop/approved/` ‚Üí Integration plan ‚Üí Install
- [ ] **FORK/MODIFY**: ‚Üí `workshop/approved/` ‚Üí Fork strategy ‚Üí `vendor/`
- [ ] **MONITOR**: ‚Üí Delete (keep analysis only)
- [ ] **PASS**: ‚Üí Delete immediately

**Checkpoint 5**: Post-processing action completed.

### Interactive Mode Checkpoint:
"üìã **Ready for Decision**: Based on analysis, I recommend [DECISION] because [REASONING].
- Strengths: [list key strengths]
- Weaknesses: [list limitations]
- Integration potential: [specific opportunities]
Your thoughts before proceeding with post-processing?"

## üìã STEP 6: Documentation & POC Decision
**‚ö†Ô∏è STOP**: Choose your documentation/implementation path:

**Decision Matrix**:
- [ ] **POC NEEDED**: For exploring integration before commitment
  - Read POC guide: `~/lev/workshop/pocs/README.md`
  - Create POC directory: `~/lev/workshop/pocs/[name]/`
  - Follow POC lifecycle (Planning ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation)
  
- [ ] **ADR NEEDED**: For architectural decisions (EXTRACT/ADOPT/FORK)
  - üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Wizard Experience Available**: Interactive decision guidance from `~/lev/docs/workflows/wizard-experience/`
  - Uses Five-Fold Path for deep analysis (evolution, impact, relationships, essence, paradigm)
  - Guides collaborative ADR creation with structured questioning
  - Handles complex integration decisions with progressive revelation
  - Create ADR: `~/lev/workshop/adrs/ADR-XXX-[title].md`
  
- [ ] **DIRECT ACTION**: For simple adoptions
  - Move to `_ref/` for reference
  - Install with pnpm for dependency
  - No additional documentation needed

- [ ] **COMBINATION**: POC first, then ADR after validation
  - Start with POC to test
  - Create ADR based on POC findings

**Checkpoint 6**: Documentation/POC path chosen and initiated.

### Interactive Mode Checkpoint:
"üìã **Ready for Documentation**: 
Should we:
1. Create ADR via wizard experience (~/lev/docs/workflows/wizard-experience/)
2. Create POC first (~/lev/workshop/pocs/README.md)
3. Direct action with minimal documentation
Your preference for documenting this decision?"

## üß† SPECIAL FOCUS: Memory System Analysis

When analyzing memory-related repos, you MUST:

1. **Check Existing Memory Implementation**:
```bash
# What memory types do we support?
cat ~/lev/packages/memory/src/types.ts

# What backends are implemented?
ls ~/lev/packages/memory/src/backends/

# What's our memory architecture?
cat ~/lev/packages/memory/docs/architecture.md
```

2. **Document Current Capabilities**:
- [ ] Memory types supported: (procedural, semantic, episodic, working, temporal)
- [ ] Backends implemented: (file, graphiti, vector stores)
- [ ] Integration patterns: (how agents use memory)

3. **Only Then Compare**: 
- What does the new repo add that we DON'T have?
- Could this enhance our existing system?
- Is this a replacement or integration opportunity?## üì¶ Large Repository Strategy (20+ components)

**DO NOT**: Try to analyze all 50+ agents individually
**DO**: Strategic sampling approach

1. **Identify Core Architecture** (required):
   - Main entry points
   - Shared libraries/utilities
   - Configuration patterns

2. **Select 3-5 Representatives**:
   - Most starred/popular components
   - Unique pattern examples
   - Different categories/types

3. **Document Sampling Decision**:
   ```yaml
   large_repo_analysis:
     total_components: 50
     analyzed_samples:
       - name: "mcp-agent-army"
         reason: "Multi-agent orchestration pattern"
       - name: "simple-mcp-agent" 
         reason: "Baseline implementation"
       - name: "pydantic-ai-series"
         reason: "Modern framework patterns"
   ```## ‚úÖ FINAL VERIFICATION

Before submitting analysis, confirm:
- [ ] All 6 steps completed sequentially
- [ ] Step 3 (Lev scan) has specific file references
- [ ] No assumptions - only evidence-based findings
- [ ] Comparison includes what Lev ACTUALLY has
- [ ] Working memory template fully completed
- [ ] Analysis saved to ~/lev/workshop/analysis/[repo]/

‚ö†Ô∏è **REMINDER**: The goal is ACCURATE COMPARISON, not speed!
