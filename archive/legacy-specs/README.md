# Legacy Design Specifications Archive

## Overview

This directory contains original design specifications from the Kingly era that have been successfully implemented in the current Leviathan ecosystem.

## Archived Documents

### `kingly-plugin-spec.md`
**Original Design**: Plugin architecture with YAML-first configuration and reverse dependency patterns
**Implementation Status**: ✅ **Fully Implemented** in `/packages/commands/`, `/plugins/@lev-os/debug/`, and other @lev-os/* packages
**Key Features Delivered**:
- YAML-first plugin configuration (`config/plugin.yaml`)
- Reverse dependency pattern (plugins import @lev-os/core)
- Ultra-lightweight process management with execa
- Integration with job systems and worktree management

### `kingly-debug-architecture.md`
**Original Design**: Universal debugging service for cross-plugin observability
**Implementation Status**: ✅ **Fully Implemented** in `/plugins/@lev-os/debug/`
**Key Features Delivered**:
- Universal logger with Winston integration (`src/logger.js`)
- Cross-plugin event tracing (`src/tracer.js`)
- Process monitoring capabilities (`src/monitor.js`)
- Centralized debug interface across all @lev-os/* packages

### `kinglycmd.md`
**Original Design**: Ultra-lightweight process management with PM2 integration
**Implementation Status**: ✅ **Fully Implemented** in `/packages/commands/`
**Key Features Delivered**:
- Process management with execa + ps-tree stack
- PID tracking and status monitoring
- Git worktree integration for parallel development
- Background process persistence and lifecycle management

## Historical Significance

These documents represent the foundational design thinking that led to the current @lev-os/* plugin ecosystem. The implementations not only delivered on the original vision but exceeded it with:

- Enhanced TypeScript integration
- Improved error handling and validation
- Better integration with Claude Code and MCP protocols
- More robust process isolation and cleanup
- Advanced debugging and observability features

## Current Implementation References

- **Plugin System**: `/plugins/@lev-os/` directory structure
- **Process Management**: `/packages/commands/src/process-manager.js`
- **Universal Debugging**: `/plugins/@lev-os/debug/src/`
- **Plugin Configuration**: `config/plugin.yaml` files in each plugin
- **Package Structure**: All @lev-os/* packages follow the original reverse dependency design

## Migration Notes

During the Kingly → Leviathan rebrand:
- All @kingly/* references were updated to @lev-os/*
- Package namespace migrated from @acme/* to @lev-os/*
- Command interfaces updated from `ks` to `lev`
- Sponsorship attribution maintained for Kingly Agency

The core architectural principles and implementation patterns remain unchanged, demonstrating the solid foundation of the original design specifications.
