# üéØ BI-DIRECTIONAL INTELLIGENCE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## Overview

Transform Kingly from a reactive session manager into a proactive intelligence partner through bi-directional decorations and enhanced job orchestration. This implements the "whisper" concept from ~/ka and bi-directional flow from ~/ceo.

## Current System Analysis

The MCP MVP has excellent foundation:
- CEO orchestration with natural language processing
- Multi-tab job distribution system (post/accept/complete)
- Session management with comprehensive handoffs
- Fractal context promotion with validation pipelines
- Auto-registration with .kingly folder bootstrapping

## Phase 1: Enhanced Ping/Lookup Decorations (Week 1)

### 1.1 Git Intelligence for Ping Commands
**Target**: `src/session-manager.js` - enhance `ping()` method

**New Features**:
- Git status analysis with commit message recommendations
- Context-aware commit type detection (feat/fix/docs/refactor)
- Pre-commit action suggestions (tests, linting, docs)
- Staging recommendations for untracked files

**Example Output**:
```
‚úÖ Session checkpoint created
üîç Git Intelligence:
  ‚Ä¢ 5 files modified in src/auth/
  ‚Ä¢ Suggested commit: "feat(auth): implement OAuth2 with refresh tokens"
  ‚Ä¢ Pre-commit actions: Run auth tests, update API documentation
  ‚Ä¢ Staging recommendation: Include config/oauth.example.json
  üí° Tip: Have you committed changes recently? This looks like a good stopping point.
```

### 1.2 Context-Aware Lookup Commands
**Target**: `bin/kingly-semantic` - enhance workflow commands

**New Features**:
- Recent ping context integration
- "Have you ping recently?" prompts for lookup commands
- Session continuity recommendations

**Example Output**:
```
‚úÖ 3r - Parallel Analysis Of All Contexts
üìù Advanced workflow for comprehensive analysis
üéØ Similarity: 89.2%

üìã Context Intelligence:
  ‚Ä¢ Recent ping: "authentication security review" (15 minutes ago)
  ‚Ä¢ Continuation suggestion: This workflow complements your current auth work
  ‚Ä¢ üí° Consider: ping --context "starting parallel analysis" before execution
```

## Phase 2: Bi-Directional Job System (Week 2)

### 2.1 Enhanced Job Command
**New Command**: `ks job <description>` - AI-driven job orchestration

**Key Innovation**: Jobs can spawn follow-up jobs automatically

### 2.2 Bi-Directional Callback Architecture
Jobs analyze their results and create follow-up jobs based on findings:

**Example Flow**:
```
User: ks job "comprehensive security audit of authentication system"

üéØ Job Analysis Complete
  ‚Ä¢ Complexity: High (8.5/10)
  ‚Ä¢ Optimal breakdown: 3 parallel jobs + 1 synthesis job
  ‚Ä¢ Estimated total: 4-6 hours

üìã Proposed Job Structure:
  1. Static Code Analysis (90 min) ‚Üí Tab A
  2. Dynamic Security Testing (120 min) ‚Üí Tab B
  3. Configuration Review (60 min) ‚Üí Tab C
  4. Auto-Synthesis Job (30 min) ‚Üí Auto-created on completion

üîÑ Bi-Directional Flow:
  ‚Ä¢ Each job completion triggers result analysis
  ‚Ä¢ If vulnerabilities found ‚Üí Auto-create remediation jobs
  ‚Ä¢ If patterns detected ‚Üí Suggest template creation
  ‚Ä¢ Final synthesis ‚Üí Generate security report + recommendations
```

## Phase 3: System-Initiated Callbacks ("Taking Control") (Week 3)

### 3.1 Proactive Pattern Detection
System detects patterns across sessions and suggests actions:

### 3.2 "Dependency Inversion" Mechanism
System can ask LLM questions and create infinite callback loops:

**Example Flow**:
```
ü§ñ Proactive Intelligence Alert
  ‚Ä¢ Pattern detected: OAuth implementations across 3 sessions
  ‚Ä¢ Analysis: Common patterns could be templated
  ‚Ä¢ Confidence: 89%
  ‚Ä¢ Estimated value: High (cross-project benefit)

Question for you: What OAuth features would be most valuable in a reusable template?

[User responds with priorities]

System: Based on your input, I'll create a job to:
1. Extract common OAuth patterns
2. Generate template with your prioritized features
3. Validate template across your existing projects
4. Create documentation and examples

This will spawn 4 connected jobs. Shall I proceed?

[Infinite callback potential with safety limits]
```

## Technical Implementation

### New Methods to Add:

#### Git Intelligence (session-manager.js):
```javascript
async analyzeGitForDecorations(context, files) {
  const gitStatus = await this.getGitStatus();
  const commitSuggestion = await this.generateCommitMessage(gitStatus, context);
  const preCommitActions = await this.suggestPreCommitActions(gitStatus);
  return { gitStatus, commitSuggestion, preCommitActions };
}
```

#### Bi-Directional Jobs (session-manager.js):
```javascript
async orchestrateJob(naturalLanguagePrompt) {
  const analysis = await this.analyzeCEOIntent(naturalLanguagePrompt);
  const jobBreakdown = await this.generateJobStructure(analysis);
  const callbackChain = await this.createCallbackChain(jobBreakdown);
  return { analysis, jobBreakdown, callbackChain };
}

async createCallbackChain(jobs) {
  // Create interconnected jobs that can spawn follow-ups
  // Each job completion triggers analysis for next steps
  // Safety limits: max 10 levels, 5-minute timeboxing
}
```

#### Context Enhancement (claude-code-adapter.js):
```javascript
async enhanceWorkflowWithContext(workflow, recentPings) {
  const contextMatch = await this.findContextCorrelation(workflow, recentPings);
  const continuationSuggestions = await this.generateContinuations(contextMatch);
  return { workflow, contextMatch, continuationSuggestions };
}
```

### New CLI Commands:
```bash
ks job <description>           # AI job orchestration with callbacks
ks patterns                    # Show detected cross-session patterns
ks callbacks                   # Monitor active callback chains
ks git-status                  # Enhanced git analysis
ks context-flow                # Show context correlations
ks stop-callbacks              # Emergency stop
```

## Safety Architecture

### Infinite Loop Prevention:
- **Circuit Breakers**: Maximum 10 callback levels, auto-disable after failures
- **Time Boxing**: 5-minute limits per callback chain
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU/memory limits with graceful degradation
- **Human Override**: Emergency stop via `ks stop-callbacks` command

### Human Control Mechanisms:
- **Confirmation Required**: All system-initiated actions need approval
- **Transparent Logging**: Full audit trail in `.kingly/logs/bi-directional.log`
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to basic mode if advanced features fail

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits:
- **Rich Context**: Every ping shows git intelligence and commit recommendations
- **Workflow Continuity**: Lookup commands connect to recent session context
- **Intelligent Coordination**: Jobs structured optimally with automatic follow-ups

### Advanced Capabilities:
- **Proactive Intelligence**: System detects patterns and suggests improvements
- **Infinite Scalability**: Complex processes handled through callback chains
- **Self-Organizing**: Templates and contexts evolve based on usage patterns

### The "Dependency Inversion" Magic:
Instead of user always driving, the system can:
1. Ask intelligent questions
2. Get LLM responses
3. Create jobs based on responses
4. Have jobs ask more questions
5. Create infinite improvement loops
6. All while maintaining human control and safety limits

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Git decorations for ping - immediate productivity value
**Phase 2 (Week 2)**: Enhanced job system with basic bi-directional flow
**Phase 3 (Week 3)**: System-initiated callbacks with full "taking control" capability

This transforms Kingly from a reactive tool into a proactive intelligence partner that can "take control" when beneficial while always respecting human oversight.

The existing fractal context promotion system provides the perfect foundation for this bi-directional intelligence to emerge and evolve organically.
