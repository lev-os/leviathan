# ⚠️ OUTDATED ROADMAP - CONTAINS INCORRECT INFORMATION

**WARNING: This roadmap contains multiple incorrect claims about the codebase state. It has been archived for historical reference only.**

**Known Incorrect Claims:**
- ❌ Job system broken → Actually works perfectly with sophisticated features
- ❌ Test suite not comprehensive → Actually has 24+ tests with full BDD framework
- ❌ Documentation missing → Actually well-documented with ADRs and complete structure  
- ❌ Package not NPM-ready → Actually ready for publication
- ❌ Major open source prep needed → Actually mostly ready

**Accurate Claims:**
- ✅ Admin Commands missing → True, admin-router.js doesn't exist

**For current status, see:** `docs/current-status.md`

# Next Steps: Admin Commands, Job System, & Open Source Launch

## **Phase 1: Admin Command Architecture** 
**Create CLI-only admin commands that bypass MCP adapters:**

### **Admin Command Structure**
- Create `src/admin-router.js` - separate from hybrid-router
- Admin commands: `register`, `unregister`, `jobs`, `system`, `deploy`
- CLI-only access via special flag or admin mode
- No exposure through MCP protocol

### **Folder Registration System**
```bash
kingly admin register /path/to/project --name "project-name"
kingly admin jobs add /path/to/project "task description"
kingly admin jobs list --project "project-name"
```

## **Phase 2: Fix & Enhance Job System**
**Complete the broken job functionality:**

### **Current Issue**
- `kingly job "test"` fails with "this.generateJobStructure is not a function"
- Job system partially implemented but missing core methods

### **Implement Missing Methods**
- Add `generateJobStructure()` method to hybrid-router
- Add `createCallbackChain()` method
- Add `calculateEstimatedTime()` and `calculateOptimalTabs()`

### **Job Management System**
- Job persistence (JSON file or lightweight DB)
- Job status tracking (pending, in-progress, completed)
- Job queuing and execution coordination
- Integration with checkpoint system for session continuity

## **Phase 3: Open Source Launch Strategy**
**Based on 2023-2024 best practices research:**

### **Versioning & Release Prep**
- Start with v0.9.0 (pre-1.0 to signal active development)
- Semantic versioning with clear breaking change communication
- Comprehensive changelog and upgrade guides

### **Documentation Structure**
- **Quick Start:** 5-minute setup and first command
- **Feature Walkthroughs:** Hybrid commands, semantic search, checkpoints
- **API Reference:** All commands with examples
- **Real-World Recipes:** Common workflows and integrations
- **Contribution Guide:** Local dev setup and PR process

### **Marketing & Community Strategy**
- **Launch platforms:** Product Hunt, Dev Hunt, Hacker News, r/programming
- **Technical content:** Blog posts showing unique hybrid command approach
- **Demo videos:** Showcasing LLM-first intelligence and flow-based UX
- **Early adopter program:** Invite power users for feedback

### **Platform Strategy**
- **GitHub:** Clean README, comprehensive docs, clear issue templates
- **NPM:** Easy installation with `npm install -g @kingly/cli`
- **Website:** Landing page with live demos and use cases
- **Community:** Discord/Slack for real-time support

## **Technical Implementation Details:**

### **Admin Commands Architecture**
- Separate router with privileged access
- Project registry with metadata storage
- Job queue with status tracking
- System health and metrics commands

### **Job System Completion**
- AI-powered job breakdown using session manager
- Callback chain generation for complex workflows
- Time estimation based on task complexity
- Multi-tab coordination for large jobs

### **Open Source Package Prep**
- Clean up internal references and paths
- Create example configurations and templates
- Build comprehensive test suite
- Package for multiple installation methods

## **Success Metrics:**
- Admin commands working with project registration
- Job system fully functional with queue management
- Documentation covers all major features
- Clean v0.9.0 release ready for community feedback
- Launch strategy targeting 1000+ GitHub stars in first month

## **Key Insights from Research:**
- **Developer Tool Marketing:** Focus on value and authentic problem-solving
- **Community Building:** Early adopters, quick feedback loops, public recognition
- **Documentation:** Quick start is critical, real-world recipes drive adoption
- **Launch Timing:** Coordinate across multiple developer platforms simultaneously
