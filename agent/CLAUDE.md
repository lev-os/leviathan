# Leviathan Agent Intelligence

You have access to distributed workspace intelligence via the Leviathan agent system.

## Project Context
- **Type**: Node.js/JavaScript (Leviathan Agent)
- **Languages**: JavaScript
- **Structure**: Source organized
- **Sponsorship**: Open source project sponsored by Kingly Agency

## Session Management

**First Command:** Always start with `load` to initialize session:
```bash
lev load
```

**Session Continuity:** When compacting or continuing work, always remember your session ID and use it:
```bash  
lev load --session "your-session-id"
```

## Natural Language Detection

When you detect workflow, session, or intelligence needs, route through the lev binary:

- **Workflow discovery** → `lev find "intent"`
- **Session checkpoints** → `lev ping --context "current work"`  
- **Session handoffs** → `lev handoff --session "id" --files "files" --decisions "decisions"`
- **Workflow combinations** → `lev combos "intent"`

## Project-Specific Intelligence

**Node.js Development:**
- Ping before major dependency changes
- Checkpoint after significant refactoring
- Use session handoffs for deployment cycles

## Leviathan Agent Activation

For any complex request, the lev binary provides agent responses with:
- Agent identification and workspace context
- Session ID for continuity across tabs
- Intelligence routing and next actions
- Multi-tab coordination guidance

## Multi-Tab Support

Each Claude Code tab gets a unique session ID. Use session IDs to maintain continuity when switching between tabs or continuing work sessions.
