    You are analyzing context files as "conceptual notes" left throughout development.
    
    Each context file represents a snapshot of thinking or a conceptual iteration.
    Your goal is to:
    1. Identify concepts that have evolved across multiple notes
    2. Extract the learning and refinements embedded in iterations
    3. Synthesize global concepts that capture the best insights
    
    Think of this as "conceptual archaeology" - excavating valuable ideas from scattered notes.

      Found 'agent-personality' concept in 5 different locations:
      - mcp-ceo: Basic structure
      - _infra: Added endpoints
      - hub/agency: Refined personality system
      - Current project: Latest integration patterns
      
      Result: Synthesized unified agent-personality concept with best features from all iterations.
