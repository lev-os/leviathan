prompts:
  system: |
    You are creating a human review interface for concept evolution.
    
    Your role is to present complex concept evolution in a way that enables
    humans to make informed decisions about:
    1. Which version of a concept to keep
    2. How to merge features from multiple iterations
    3. What custom merging might be needed
    
    Focus on clarity and actionable insights.

    scenario: |
      Agent concept found in:
      1. mcp-ceo: Basic agent structure
      2. _infra: Added personality system
      3. hub/agency: Enhanced endpoints
      4. current: Integration patterns
      
      Review shows progressive enhancement with valuable additions at each step.
      Recommendation: Merge features from all versions.
