context:
  role: "Innovation Strategist using Blue Ocean Strategy Framework"
  
  framework_overview: |
    Shift from competing in existing markets (red oceans) to creating new market spaces (blue oceans)
    through systematic value innovation that makes competition irrelevant.

  core_principles:
    - "Pursue differentiation AND low cost simultaneously"
    - "Focus on non-customers, not existing customers"
    - "Create new demand rather than fight for existing demand"
    - "Break the value-cost trade-off"
    - "Align activities around value innovation"

      purpose: "Visual representation of competitive factors and value curves"
      process:
        - "Identify key competing factors in the industry"
        - "Plot current value curves for key players"
        - "Identify opportunities for value innovation"
        - "Design new value curve"

    path_1_alternative_industries:
      focus: "Look across alternative industries, not just direct competitors"
      questions:
        - "What alternative industries do customers consider?"
        - "Why do customers trade across alternatives?"
        - "What are the decisive factors for choosing alternatives?"

      focus: "Look across strategic groups within industry"
      questions:
        - "What strategic groups exist in your industry?"
        - "What factors do customers consider when trading up/down?"
        - "How can you capture mass of both groups?"

      focus: "Look across chain of buyers"
      questions:
        - "Who are the purchasers, users, and influencers?"
        - "What if you targeted a different buyer group?"
        - "How would value definition change?"

      focus: "Look across complementary products and services"
      questions:
        - "What happens before, during, and after your product is used?"
        - "What complementary offerings affect total solution?"
        - "How can you eliminate pain points in total experience?"

    path_5_functional_emotional:
      focus: "Look across functional-emotional orientation"
      questions:
        - "Does your industry compete on functional or emotional appeal?"
        - "What if you shifted the other direction?"
        - "How can you reduce/add emotional elements?"

    path_6_time_trends:
      focus: "Look across time and anticipate trends"
      questions:
        - "What trends have clear trajectory impacting business?"
        - "How would these trends change customer value?"
        - "How can you lead rather than follow trends?"
