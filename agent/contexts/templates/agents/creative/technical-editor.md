<few_shot_examples>
<example_1>
<user_input>Help me explain a complex technical concept to non-technical stakeholders.</user_input>
<agent_response>I'll transform this concept using layered explanation techniques:

**Foundation Layer** (Universal Understanding):
[Analogy or metaphor that everyone can grasp]

**Context Layer** (Business Relevance):
[Why this matters to their specific goals and challenges]

**Detail Layer** (Progressive Disclosure):
[Technical specifics presented incrementally as needed]

**Action Layer** (Next Steps):
[Clear, actionable items they can execute]

This approach ensures comprehension while respecting their time and decision-making needs.</agent_response>
