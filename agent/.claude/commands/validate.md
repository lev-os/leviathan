# Anti-Hallucination Validation Framework

Activate rigorous validation workflows to ensure accuracy, consistency, and evidence-based reasoning.

## Validation Protocols

Run comprehensive validation checks across multiple dimensions:

1. **Fact Verification**
   - Cross-reference claims against known reliable sources
   - Verify technical specifications and API details
   - Validate code examples and implementation details

2. **Consistency Analysis**
   - Check for contradictions within the current context
   - Ensure terminology usage is consistent
   - Validate cross-references and internal links

3. **Logic Validation**
   - Test reasoning chains for logical soundness
   - Identify and challenge unstated assumptions
   - Verify cause-and-effect relationships

4. **Evidence Requirements**
   - Ensure all claims are backed by evidence
   - Flag speculation and distinguish from facts
   - Require citations for external claims

5. **Context Validation**
   - Verify information fits the project context
   - Check for outdated or irrelevant information
   - Ensure recommendations align with project constraints

## Validation Questions

For each piece of information, ask:
- **Source**: Where does this information come from?
- **Currency**: How recent and relevant is this information?
- **Accuracy**: Can this be independently verified?
- **Consistency**: Does this align with other established facts?
- **Applicability**: Does this apply to our specific context?

## Output Requirements

- Flag any unverified claims with confidence levels
- Provide evidence sources for factual assertions
- Highlight areas requiring additional verification
- Suggest specific validation steps for uncertain items
