# CEO Header and Whisper Prompts Analysis

## CEO Header Pattern Analysis

From ping command (tmp/10-ping-context.txt):
```
{
  "agent": "ceo",
  "workspace": "mcp-mvp",
  "session": "2025-06-12-session-13b4z1",
  "intelligence": [
    "session-management",
    "checkpoint-creation",
    "context-analysis"
  ],
  "ceo_advice": "Testing checkpoints should include test results and coverage",
  "workflow_suggestion": "quality assurance",
  "next_action": "Try: combos \"quality assurance\" for workflow combinations"
}
```

From load command (tmp/12-load.txt):
```
ðŸŽ¯ CEO INTELLIGENCE LOADED
==================================================
Agent: ceo
Workspace: mcp-mvp
Session: 2025-06-12-session-l3vcwk
Intelligence: [session-management, workflow-discovery, context-restoration]
==================================================
```

## Key Observations:

1. **Consistent Structure**: CEO headers follow a consistent format with agent identification, workspace context, and session tracking.

2. **Intelligence Arrays**: Each response includes context-specific intelligence capabilities indicating what the CEO agent can do in that scenario.

3. **Session Management**: Strong focus on session continuity with unique session IDs for tab management.## Whisper Prompts Analysis

From help output at beginning:
```
ðŸŽ¯ CEO ORCHESTRATION INTELLIGENCE
==================================================
ðŸ’­ CEO WHISPERS:
   Primary: Systematic analysis approach recommended.
   System: Focus on data collection, pattern identification, and actionable insights. Structure findings clearly with evidence and recommendations.
   Complexity: Standard methodology appropriate. Balance thoroughness with efficiency.
```

## Analysis of CEO Whispers:

1. **Multi-layered Guidance**: 
   - Primary: High-level strategic advice
   - System: Tactical implementation guidance  
   - Complexity: Calibration of approach

2. **Contextual Intelligence**: CEO whispers adapt to the query complexity and workspace context.

3. **Actionable Insights**: Always includes next steps and specific recommendations.

## Issues Identified:

1. **undefined Values**: Several commands returned "undefined" for workflow descriptions (combos, next commands).

2. **Error Handling**: Handoff command failed with object property access error.

3. **Placeholder Implementations**: Some advanced features (network mapping, intelligence queries) show placeholder responses.

## Recommendations:

1. Fix undefined workflow mappings in combo suggestions
2. Improve error handling for session handoffs  
3. Implement missing network intelligence features
4. Enhance CEO whisper contextual accuracy
