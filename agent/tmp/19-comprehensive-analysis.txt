## CEO Header & Whisper Prompt Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Needed:
1. **Workflow Mapping**: Fix 1f prompt optimization workflow corruption
2. **Undefined Values**: Resolve "undefined" responses in combo suggestions
3. **Session Handoff**: Fix object property access errors

### Strategic Improvements:
1. **Apply 3b (CEO Intelligence)**: Use multi-agent perspective for CEO header design
2. **Apply Creative Problem Solving**: Systematically improve whisper prompt effectiveness
3. **Apply User Research**: Understand actual user needs for CEO guidance
4. **Apply System Optimization**: Holistic improvement of entire CEO intelligence system

### Architectural Insights:
- CEO headers maintain good session/workspace context structure
- Whisper prompts provide valuable multi-layered guidance
- System shows strong foundational architecture but needs debugging
- High-value workflows available but need mapping fixes

## Next Actions:
1. Debug workflow mapping system (priority: critical)
2. Implement comprehensive CEO intelligence analysis using 3b
3. Apply creative problem solving to prompt architecture
4. Conduct user research on CEO guidance effectiveness
