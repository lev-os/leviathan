## Manual Review Still Needed:
Check remaining groups in ./diffs/ directory - these contain actual differences requiring human analysis.

## Next Steps:
1. Focus manual review on remaining diff groups
2. Use tracker CSV to track consolidation decisions  
3. Execute consolidation for high-priority groups first
4. Test after each consolidation

## Consolidation Strategy for Identical Files:
Since these files are identical, you can:
1. Choose any one as canonical (typically the mcp-mvp version)
2. Remove duplicates safely
3. Update any references if needed
4. Archive removed files for safety
