## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### **Timing Urgency**
- Research shows **wide open patent landscape**
- First-to-file system means speed is crucial
- Provisional gives 12-month priority window

### **Patent Quality Requirements**
- Must enable someone skilled in field to implement
- Need sufficient technical detail
- Strong drawings/diagrams essential for software patents

### **Subject Matter Eligibility (Alice Test)**
- Software patents must solve technical problems
- Avoid "abstract idea" rejections
- Focus on technical improvements and hardware integration
