# Step 6: Hardware, Marketing & Creative Domain Expert Perspectives

## âš¡ ELECTRICAL ENGINEER PERSPECTIVE

**AGENT ACTIVATED**: Electrical Engineer - Circuit Design & Signal Processing Expert

**ANALYSIS OF GO DUAL-BINARY ARCHITECTURE**:

*"From an electrical engineering standpoint, this is **excellent systems architecture**. The separation between control logic (go-agent) and power/execution (go-kernal) mirrors fundamental electrical design principles.*

**SYSTEMS ENGINEERING ANALYSIS:**
Your architecture follows proven electrical design patterns:
- **Control Circuit** (go-agent): High-level logic, decision making, signal routing
- **Power Circuit** (go-kernal): Heavy lifting, direct hardware interface, reliable execution
- **Interface Protocol**: Clean isolation between control and power domains

**ELECTRICAL DESIGN VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Load Analysis**: What happens under concurrent operation stress?
2. **Thermal Management**: CPU/memory usage patterns under sustained load
3. **Signal Integrity**: Communication protocol between binaries - latency, jitter, reliability
4. **Power Budget**: Resource consumption scaling with user load
5. **EMI/EMC Considerations**: Process isolation preventing interference

**PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS:**
- **Response Time**: <1ms syscall should be achievable with proper optimization
- **Throughput**: Concurrent operation handling without degradation
- **Reliability**: 99.99% uptime with graceful fault handling
- **Scalability**: Linear performance scaling with resource allocation

**ELECTRICAL ENGINEER'S TECHNICAL CONCERNS:**
- **Grounding Strategy**: How do you prevent 'ground loops' in workflow execution?
- **Noise Immunity**: What happens when semantic lookup returns ambiguous results?
- **Protection Circuits**: Constitutional framework as 'circuit protection' - good design
- **Test Points**: Comprehensive monitoring and debugging interfaces needed

**VERDICT**: *'Solid electrical engineering principles applied to software architecture. The isolation between control and power domains is textbook good design. I'd want to see detailed load testing and thermal analysis before production deployment.'*"
