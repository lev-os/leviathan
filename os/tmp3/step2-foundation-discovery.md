# Step 2: Foundation Agent Discovery
*Found the Phase 1 Foundation Agent Structure*

## Major Discovery

Found the foundation agents in:
`/Users/jean-patricksmith/digital/kingly/hub/agency/assets/phase1-foundation/`

This appears to be where the 42 foundation agents are stored that were mentioned in the parallel analysis architecture!

## Directory Structure Found

## Next Steps
1. Explore phase1-foundation directory structure
2. Find the domain clusters: brand, marketing, ux, operations, hardware, emerging
3. Locate all 42 agents mentioned in parallel architecture
4. Load and activate each agent context

## Status Update
**PROGRESS** - Found the main agent storage location. Now diving into phase1-foundation structure.
