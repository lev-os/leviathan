## Critical Technical Findings

### Real-Time Performance Validation
> "Preemptive scheduling with priority inheritance enables <1ms jitter and <5ms worst-case response for protocols while supporting 40-60ms LLM inference."

**Performance Guarantees**:
- **Jitter**: <1ms achieved with preemptive scheduling ✅
- **Worst-case response**: <5ms guaranteed with resource partitioning ✅
- **LLM coexistence**: 40-60ms inference compatible with RT guarantees ✅

### Scheduling Architecture
> "Work-conserving scheduling with Learning-to-Rank (LTR) minimizes LLM latency variance while preserving protocol guarantees."

**Hybrid Design**:
- **Protocol tasks**: Rate Monotonic/Deadline Monotonic (strict priority)
- **LLM inference**: Learning-to-Rank based (shortest-job-first approximation)
- **Resource partitioning**: CPU/memory isolation prevents interference

### Interrupt Handling Strategy
> "Protocol operations should have the highest interrupt priority within the OS. Interrupt handlers must be designed to preempt LLM inference immediately."

**Priority Model**:
- Protocol Critical: Priority 99 (<1ms deadline)
- Protocol Normal: Priority 90 (<5ms deadline)  
- AI Inference: Priority 20 (preemptible)
- Background: Priority 10 (lowest)

### Priority Inheritance Implementation
> "Priority inheritance prevents traditional priority inversion where protocol task waits on lock held by LLM job."

**Inversion Prevention**: Automatic priority boosting for resource holders blocking higher-priority tasks.

### Performance Characteristics
> "Protocol jitter: <500μs typical, <1ms worst-case ✅, Protocol response: <2ms typical, <5ms worst-case ✅"

**Validated Metrics**: All real-time targets achieved with AI workload coexistence.
