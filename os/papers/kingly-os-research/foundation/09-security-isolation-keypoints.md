## Critical Technical Findings

### Hardware-Enforced Security
> "SMEP/SMAP/CET + microkernel isolation achieves zero privilege escalation risk with <5% performance overhead."

**Security Mechanisms**:
- **SMEP**: Blocks kernel execution of user pages
- **SMAP**: Blocks kernel access to user memory (<1% overhead)
- **CET**: Control-flow integrity (<2% overhead)
- **Total overhead**: <5% ✅

### Isolation Architecture
> "Sandbox containers (gVisor-style) provide optimal security/performance balance."

**Isolation Methods Comparison**:
- OS Containers: Moderate security, <1% overhead
- **Sandbox Containers**: High security, <3% overhead ✅
- Microkernels: Very high security, 5-10% overhead
- Hardware VMs: Highest security, 10-15% overhead

### Memory Protection Strategy
> "Hardware-enforced memory isolation with SMEP/SMAP/CET provides strong security boundaries while maintaining performance."

**Multi-Domain Isolation**:
- AI inference: Restricted execution context
- Protocol handling: Privileged kernel access
- Shared communication: Controlled buffers with validation

### Side-Channel Mitigation
> "Cache partitioning + speculation control prevents observable interference between AI and protocol workloads."

**Mitigation Techniques**:
- CPU cache partitioning (Intel CAT)
- Speculative execution controls (IBRS, STIBP, SSBD)
- Core assignment isolation
- Constant-time operations

### Security Validation Framework
> "Runtime integrity monitoring with <1% overhead enables continuous security validation."

**Monitoring Components**:
- HMAC integrity validation
- Anomaly detection for behavior monitoring
- Automated threat response
- Audit logging for forensic analysis
