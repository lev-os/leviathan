## Critical Technical Findings

### Performance Breakthrough
> "Event-driven + lock-free architecture achieves 100k+ req/s per core on Pi 4 with <1ms median latency."

**Quantified Performance**:
- **Throughput**: 200-300k protocol requests/second across 4 Cortex-A72 cores
- **Latency**: <1ms median, <5ms 99th percentile
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling to 4 cores validated

### Architecture Superiority
> "Event-driven, lock-free: ~0.7ms median latency, 90-100k req/s per core, ~4ms 99th percentile latency, Excellent power efficiency"

**Vs Alternatives**:
- Polling + locks: ~2ms latency, 60k req/s, poor efficiency
- Event-driven wins on all metrics âœ…

### MCP Protocol Adaptation
> "MCP provides stateful context management ideal for kernel integration: Session State: Per-agent context maintained in kernel memory, Resource Exposure: Dynamic tool/data access via kernel descriptors"

**Integration Strategy**: Kernel-native session management with zero-copy communication.

### Lock-Free Data Structures
> "Session Lookup: O(1) average, lock-free reads via RCU, Request Queuing: O(1) enqueue/dequeue, wait-free on fast path"

**Scalability Foundation**: RCU + lock-free rings enable true multi-core scaling.

### Zero-Copy Implementation
> "Zero-copy buffer management, Memory-mapped model loading strategies, RDMA integration for future distributed deployments"

**Performance Optimization**: Eliminates memory bottlenecks through shared memory rings.
