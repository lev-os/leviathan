## Critical Technical Findings

### Performance Breakthrough
> "PagedAttention + Jenga two-level allocator achieves <50ms allocation latency with 79.6% memory utilization improvement."

**Quantified Results**:
- **Allocation latency**: <50ms guaranteed for real-time operations ✅
- **Memory efficiency**: 79.6% utilization improvement ✅
- **NUMA optimization**: 5-10% throughput improvement on ARM ✅

### Allocation Strategy
> "Jenga-inspired allocator design: Level 1: Large, persistent allocations (model weights), Level 2: Small, transient allocations (activations, KV cache)"

**Two-Level Architecture**:
- **Large Pool**: 1MB+ allocations (model weights)
- **Small Pool**: <64KB allocations (activations, KV cache)
- **Performance**: Different optimization strategies per allocation type

### Memory-Mapped Model Loading
> "Zero-downtime model swap: Memory-map new model, Prefetch into cache, Atomic pointer swap, Cleanup old mapping"

**Hot-Swap Strategy**: Atomic model replacement without service interruption.

### ARM Memory Optimization
> "NUMA-aware allocation provides 5-10% throughput gain on ARM."

**Optimization Techniques**:
- Local NUMA node allocation
- Hugepage usage for large tensors
- ARM-specific cache hierarchy optimization
- Bandwidth monitoring and throttling

### Real-Time Guarantees
> "Guaranteed sub-50ms allocation: Fast path immediate allocation, Slow path emergency compaction with deadline enforcement"

**RT Memory Pool**: Pre-allocated pool with spinlock-based fast allocation for protocol operations.
