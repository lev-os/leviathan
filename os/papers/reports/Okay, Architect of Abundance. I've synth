Okay, Architect of Abundance. I've synthesized the provided documents and translated their contents into a series of actionable templates and directives for our automated CEO, Marketing, and Development agents. These are designed for recursive execution and aim to reduce global stress by creating intuitive, empowering solutions.

Here are the directives, organized for clarity and action:

I. CEO Agent Directives (Strategic Orchestration & System Integrity)

🎯 Key Insight: The CEO agent must ensure all initiatives align with a core strategy of user empowerment through simplicity, virality by design, and obsessive focus on a single key metric, while continuously learning from operational data and past performance.
Action Plan:
Directive CEO-1: Strategic Focus & Postmortems:
Enforce obsessive focus on one core mission and one primary success metric (e.g., 7-day retention) for projects. 
Mandate logging and analysis of all past product/channel failures to extract learnings and inform pivots. 
Recursive Prompt: "Perform a premortem: Why might the current [Project Name] fail? List top risks and mitigation strategies." 
Directive CEO-2: Systemization & Organizational Design:
Oversee the design and implementation of a lean, AI-enhanced operational system encompassing customer understanding, system design, growth engineering, and agile execution. 

Champion a flat or team-based organizational structure, incorporating dedicated AI operational roles. 
Implement 90-day organizational review loops to identify and resolve bottlenecks. 
Recursive Prompt: "Generate a lean, AI-native org chart for [Project/Team Name] and a 30-day sprint plan for [Objective, e.g., launch]." 
Directive CEO-3: Pricing & Monetization Oversight:
Approve pricing strategies that utilize psychological nudges to maximize Lifetime Value (LTV) and Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), balancing user trust with conversion goals. 

Ensure pricing models are framed around lifestyle upgrades and aspirational goals, with clear value propositions. 


Impact Assessment:
🧠 Cortisol Reduction: High (clear focus reduces team stress; simple systems are easier to manage)
💰 Economic Opportunity: High (optimized systems, pricing, and focus drive revenue and market penetration)
II. Marketing Agent Directives (Growth, Engagement & Virality)

🎯 Key Insight: The Marketing agent must engineer virality and drive growth through compelling "magic moments," systematic comment engagement, ROI-focused influencer collaborations, and psychologically optimized pricing presentations.
Action Plan:
Directive MKT-1: "Wow" Moment Amplification & UGC:
Identify and amplify a 3-second "magic moment" within the product that is instantly shareable. 

Embed auto-share CTAs and visual badges post-action to encourage UGC from Day 1. 



Template: Snap & Score™ Feature - "Your food, your health grade in one snap."  Output includes score, visual summary, emoji, and share hooks. 

Directive MKT-2: Comment Growth Engine (TikTok/Reels Focus):
Deploy curiosity-seeding comments on social media posts, categorized by mystery, challenge, and social proof. 


Implement a tiered auto-response library for rapid, valuable engagement with comments. 



Utilize UGC comment laddering to simulate organic discussion and drive further engagement. 
Template: TikTok Comment SOP: For each post, seed 3 comments (mystery, lifestyle, testimonial), reply within 5 mins using scripts, add "tag a friend" UGC reply, and include a "Wanna see X next?" CTA every 3rd reply. 
Directive MKT-3: ROI-Driven Influencer Strategy:
Prioritize TikTok creators with 1-3% engagement over large followings. 

Structure deals based on CPM<$10 and RPM>$30, negotiating monthly bundles (e.g., 4 posts for $3,000). 

Recursive Prompt: "Build a Notion tracker for CPM, RPM, avg views, and engagement rates across [Number] creators." 
Directive MKT-4: Pricing Presentation & Psychology:
Present pricing tiers using lifestyle-oriented language and psychological anchors that frame annual plans as the most valuable and aspirational choice. 



Template: "Choose Healthy.ai Plans"  (Healthy Hint - $12.99/mo; Feel Good Flex - $14.99/mo; Your Healthiest Year Ever - $99/year, emphasizing savings and commitment ). Use copy that builds trust and highlights benefits. 




Impact Assessment:
🧠 Cortisol Reduction: Medium (clear marketing plays reduce ambiguity; positive engagement can be uplifting)
💰 Economic Opportunity: High (engineered virality, effective influencer spend, and optimized pricing directly drive customer acquisition and revenue)
III. Development & Product Agent Directives (UX, System Design & Automation)

🎯 Key Insight: The Development agent must build a simple, scalable, and engaging product by focusing on core user needs, optimizing flows before automation, and designing for "magic moments" that encourage sharing and retention.
Action Plan:
Directive DEV-1: User-Centric "Magic Moment" Feature Development:
Develop features that provide instant, tangible value and a "wow" experience within seconds of user interaction. 

Specification: "Snap & Score™" Feature:
Input: User meal photo. 
Processing (Al): Detect food types, portion sizes, calculate nutritional breakdown (calories, macros), assign Health Score (0-100) based on user goals. 
Output (3 seconds): Confetti animation, score display (e.g., "82/100 Great Balance!"), visual nutrient summary, emoji reaction. 
Directive DEV-2: System Design for Scalability & Simplicity:
Design core systems (Marketing, Sales, Retention, Ops, Support) with 5-step user flows, optimizing for simplicity and conversion before implementing automation. 
Implement an automation hierarchy: Simple (GPT prompts for summaries), Complex (auto-segmentation and nudges), Advanced (Zapier/Mixpanel for trigger-based outreach). 
Recursive Prompt: "Blueprint a 5-step system for [Feature Name, e.g., Calorie Snap] that includes shareable moment triggers and is streamlined for automation readiness." 
Directive DEV-3: UX Simplicity & Onboarding:
Conduct feature audits to cut non-core flows by ~30%. 
Design a 3-tap onboarding process with minimal text (max 10 words per screen), focusing on 5-word benefit statements. 
Recursive Prompt: "Rewrite the current onboarding flow into 3 screens, with 10 words or fewer per screen, emphasizing core benefits." 
Directive DEV-4: Customer Understanding through AI Research:
Utilize an Empathy Mapping + Netnography Loop: Collect user pain points and emotional context from social media (Reddit, TikTok comments, forums). 
Employ GPT to analyze data into "Say / Think / Feel / Do" quadrants to reveal unmet needs and inform UX/feature upgrades. 

Recursive Prompt: "Analyze [Source: e.g., Reddit thread URL] for pain points, motivations, or surprise regarding [Topic: e.g., calorie tracking apps]. Create an empathy map summary and recommend 3 UX/feature upgrades." 
Impact Assessment:
🧠 Cortisol Reduction: High (simple, intuitive products reduce user frustration and cognitive load)
💰 Economic Opportunity: High (engaging UX drives retention; scalable systems support growth)
These directives should provide a solid foundation for our autonomous agents to begin architecting abundance. Each directive is designed for iterative improvement and scaling. Ready for the next cycle?

Show thinking
Okay, Architect. I've expanded the templates with concrete examples across three distinct verticals: "MindWell AI" (B2C SaaS for mental wellness), "EcoBloom" (D2C E-commerce for sustainable home goods), and "SkillUp Nexus" (Online platform for professional micro-courses).

This approach should provide the LLMs with clearer contextual understanding for generating specific, actionable outputs.

Here are the expanded templates and directives:

I. CEO Agent Directives (Expanded Examples)

A. Directive CEO-1: Strategic Focus & Postmortems
* Core Principle: Maintain sharp focus and proactively anticipate potential failure points to ensure robust strategy execution.
* Recursive Prompt Template for CEO Agent (to assign to strategic sub-agent):
```
"Initiate Premortem Analysis for:
Project Name: [User-Defined Project Name]
Vertical: [MindWell AI | EcoBloom | SkillUp Nexus]
Context: [Briefly describe the project's goal]

    Task:
    1. Identify the top 3-5 potential risks that could lead to project failure, specifically considering challenges common to the [Vertical] sector (e.g., user adoption for SaaS, supply chain for D2C, content relevance for platforms).
    2. For each risk, propose 1-2 concrete mitigation strategies.
    3. Define one key success metric for this project that aligns with our obsessive focus on [e.g., 7-day retention, customer lifetime value, course completion rate].

    Output Format: Structured report with Risks, Mitigation, and Key Success Metric."
    ```
* **Vertical Application Examples (Illustrative internal thinking for the LLM when using the template):**
