## 🎯 The Order Matters

**Why this sequence?**
1. **Core first** (22-25): Can't build house without foundation
2. **Intelligence next** (26-28): Add the smart features
3. **Compatibility** (29-32): Make it work with existing world
4. **Production** (33-36): Make it reliable for real use
5. **Advanced** (37-41): Add powerful extras

**Each builds on the previous** - like assembling a rocket where each stage needs the one below it.
