# My-Go-Service Programming Principles

This document contains go specific principles for the my-go-service project.

1. Use Go's built-in error handling patterns
2. Prefer composition over inheritance
3. Keep interfaces small and focused
4. Use gofmt for consistent code formatting
5. Write clear, descriptive variable names
6. Use channels for goroutine communication
7. Handle errors explicitly, don't ignore them
