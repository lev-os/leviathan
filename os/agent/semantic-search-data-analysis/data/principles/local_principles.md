# Data-Analysis Programming Principles

This document contains python specific principles for the data-analysis project.

1. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
2. Use type hints for better code clarity
3. Write docstrings for all public functions
4. Prefer list comprehensions over loops when appropriate
5. Use virtual environments for dependency isolation
6. Handle exceptions explicitly with try/except
7. Use descriptive variable and function names
