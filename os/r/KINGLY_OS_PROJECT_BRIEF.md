# Kingly OS: Protocol-as-Kernel Linux Implementation
## Project Brief & Research Strategy

### Executive Summary
Kingly OS represents a paradigm shift in operating system design, implementing protocol-as-kernel architecture on a Linux foundation. By replacing traditional kernel abstractions with protocol-first primitives and embedding lightweight LLMs for dynamic context assembly, we create an OS that scales from embedded ARM devices to distributed cloud infrastructure.

#### 4. Key Components
