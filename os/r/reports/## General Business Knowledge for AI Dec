## General Business Knowledge for AI Decision-Making

**Source: Harvard Business Review's Must-Reads All Books in One (HBR)**

**HBR - Managing Yourself:**
* **Key Themes:** Self-awareness, time management, career development, managing stress, work-life balance, building on strengths.
* **Core Principles:**
    * **Managing Oneself (Peter Drucker):** Understand your strengths, how you perform, your values, where you belong, and what you can contribute. Take responsibility for your career.
    * **Management Time: Who's Got the Monkey? (William Oncken Jr. & Donald L. Wass):** Managers should ensure that "monkeys" (problems/tasks) stay with their rightful owners (subordinates) to develop initiative and free up managerial time.
    * **How Will You Measure Your Life? (Clayton M. Christensen):** Apply business principles to personal life. Allocate resources (time, energy, talent) deliberately. Create a strategy for your life. Maintain high ethical standards.
    * **Emotional Intelligence (Daniel Goleman):** Self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skill are critical for leadership success.
    * **What to Ask the Person in the Mirror (Robert S. Kaplan):** Regularly reflect on your vision, time allocation, feedback, succession planning, and self-care.
    * **Strengths-Based Development:** Focus on developing and leveraging individual strengths rather than solely trying to fix weaknesses.

**HBR - Managing People:**
* **Key Themes:** Motivation, leadership, team building, performance management, delegation.
* **Core Principles:**
    * **One More Time: How Do You Motivate Employees? (Frederick Herzberg):** True motivation comes from "motivators" (achievement, recognition, responsibility, growth) not just "hygiene factors" (salary, job security, working conditions).
    * **The Discipline of Teams (Jon R. Katzenbach & Douglas K. Smith):** Real teams require a common purpose, specific performance goals, complementary skills, commitment to a common approach, and mutual accountability.
    * **Leading Change: Why Transformation Efforts Fail (John P. Kotter):** Successful change requires an 8-step process: Establish urgency, form a powerful guiding coalition, create a vision, communicate the vision, empower broad-based action, generate short-term wins, consolidate gains, and anchor new approaches in the culture.
    * **Fair Process: Managing in the Knowledge Economy (W. Chan Kim & Renée Mauborgne):** Procedural justice (engagement, explanation, expectation clarity) is crucial for gaining trust and commitment during decision-making and change.

**HBR - Strategy:**
* **Key Themes:** Competitive advantage, industry analysis, value creation, innovation, strategic positioning.
* **Core Principles:**
    * **What is Strategy? (Michael E. Porter):** Strategy is about being different. It means performing different activities or similar activities differently. It requires trade-offs, creating fit among activities, and achieving a sustainable competitive advantage. Operational effectiveness is not strategy.
    * **The Core Competence of the Corporation (C.K. Prahalad & Gary Hamel):** Focus on developing and leveraging core competencies – the collective learning in the organization, especially how to coordinate diverse production skills and integrate multiple streams of technologies – to create new businesses and adapt to changing opportunities.
    * **Blue Ocean Strategy (W. Chan Kim & Renée Mauborgne):** Create uncontested market space by making the competition irrelevant. Focus on value innovation – creating a leap in value for buyers and your company, thereby opening up new demand.
    * **The Innovator's Dilemma (Clayton M. Christensen):** Successful companies can fail by missing out on disruptive innovations because they focus on sustaining innovations for their current, most profitable customers.
    * **Competing on Analytics (Thomas H. Davenport):** Organizations can achieve competitive advantage through the sophisticated use of data and analytics to make better decisions and improve business processes.

**HBR - Leadership:**
* **Key Themes:** Vision, influence, decision-making, inspiring others, ethical leadership.
* **Core Principles:**
    * **What Makes a Leader? (Daniel Goleman - also in Managing Yourself):** Emotional intelligence is paramount.
    * **Level 5 Leadership: The Triumph of Humility and Fierce Resolve (Jim Collins):** Level 5 leaders blend personal humility with intense professional will. They are ambitious for the company, not themselves.
    * **Crucibles of Leadership (Warren G. Bennis & Robert J. Thomas):** Transformative experiences, or crucibles, can shape leaders by forcing them to learn and grow. Essential leadership skills include engaging others in shared meaning, a distinctive and compelling voice, a sense of integrity, and adaptive capacity.

* **Key Themes:** Mindset, manifestation, goal achievement, subconscious mind, persistence, faith, service.
* **Core Principles:**
    * **Burning Desire:** The starting point of all achievement. A white-hot, all-consuming desire for a definite chief aim.
    * **Faith:** Absolute belief in the attainment of one's desire. Visualizing and believing in the unseen.
    * **Auto-Suggestion:** Influencing the subconscious mind through repeated positive affirmations and visualizations to develop faith.
    * **Specialized Knowledge:** Acquiring and applying knowledge relevant to one's purpose.
    * **Imagination:** The workshop of the mind where plans are created. Both synthetic (arranging old concepts) and creative (inspiration, hunches) imagination.
    * **Organized Planning:** Crystallizing desire into definite, actionable plans. Forming a "Master Mind" alliance.
    * **Decision:** Definiteness of decision. Overcoming procrastination.
    * **Persistence:** Sustained effort necessary to induce faith. Not stopping until the goal is achieved.
    * **Power of the Master Mind:** Coordination of knowledge and effort, in a spirit of harmony, between two or more people, for the attainment of a definite purpose.
    * **The Subconscious Mind:** The connecting link between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence. It can be programmed through auto-suggestion.
    * **The Sixth Sense (Creative Imagination/Intuition):** Connection to Infinite Intelligence, leading to flashes of insight and inspiration.
    * **Law of Vibration/Mental Vibration:** Thoughts are forms of energy and have a vibratory rate. Like attracts like. Maintaining a high positive vibration attracts desired outcomes. (This is presented as Hill's "lost" secret).
    * **Service:** The principle of giving value first to receive value in return. True riches come from serving others.
    * **Six Steps to Riches:**
        1.  Fix in your mind the exact amount of money (or specific goal).
        2.  Determine exactly what you intend to give in return.
        3.  Establish a definite date.
        4.  Create a definite plan and begin at once.
        5.  Write out a clear, concise statement of the above four points.
        6.  Read this written statement aloud twice daily, seeing and feeling yourself already in possession of the goal.
