## 🤖 RECURSIVE AUTONOMOUS INSTRUCTIONS

### When User Says "Look at README"
1. **Check Progress Status** below - find next incomplete item
2. **Execute that research** using Perplexity with advanced prompting
3. **Save results** to appropriate folder with structured markdown
4. **Update progress tracker** - mark complete, move to next
5. **Repeat** until all research phases complete
6. **Signal completion** when ready for synthesis phase

### Research Execution Protocol
- Use `perp` command for Perplexity with advanced prompting techniques
- Each prompt should be enhanced with context from patent application
- Save raw results + synthesized insights in each file
- Cross-reference findings between related prompts
- Flag critical decisions needed or contradictory information

## 🎓 FINAL KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER GOALS

### Crash Course Requirements
**Target Audience**: Intelligent developer, new to OS architecture
**Learning Objectives**:
1. **OS Fundamentals** - Kernel vs userspace, drivers, system calls
2. **Linux Architecture** - How traditional Linux works (to contrast with Kingly)
3. **Real-time Systems** - Why timing matters for AI/LLM integration
4. **Memory Management** - Virtual memory, paging, LLM memory requirements
5. **Embedded Constraints** - Power, thermal, memory limitations on Pi
6. **Our Innovation** - Why protocol-as-kernel is revolutionary

### Metaphor Library for Complex Concepts
- **Kernel**: The "butler" managing the "mansion" (hardware)
- **System Calls**: "Service requests" between "guests" (apps) and "butler" (kernel)
- **Memory Management**: "Room assignments" in a "hotel" with "VIP suites" (kernel space)
- **Scheduling**: "Air traffic control" for "planes" (processes) using "runways" (CPU cores)
- **Device Drivers**: "Translators" between "kernel" and "foreign hardware delegates"
- **LLM Integration**: Adding an "AI advisor" to the "butler" for "smart decisions"

## 🔄 CURRENT STATUS
**Active Phase**: Foundation Research
**Next Action**: Execute prompt 1 (architecture-fundamentals.md)
**Completion Trigger**: User says "look at readme" → Execute next research item

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
1. **No Analysis Paralysis** - Execute systematically, synthesize later
2. **Cross-Reference Findings** - Note conflicts/synergies between research areas  
3. **Flag Decision Points** - Mark where user input will be needed
4. **Maintain Patent Alignment** - All research must support patent claims
5. **Focus on Raspberry Pi** - Embedded constraints drive all decisions
6. **Performance Targets** - < 5% overhead, < 2 sec boot time

---

**Remember**: This research informs a 12-month development timeline. Quality and comprehensiveness now saves months of implementation mistakes later. Execute with precision and strategic thinking.
