# Go Dual-Binary Architecture Roadmap
*Complete 4-Week Implementation Timeline*

## Executive Summary

**Vision**: Replace ~/mvp with high-performance Go dual-binary architecture implementing bidirectional LLM concepts from ~/ceo research and semantic workflow discovery from ~/mvp/os.

**Architecture**: go-agent (semantic intelligence) + go-kernal (pure syscall execution)
**Performance**: <1ms quick lookups, <50ms semantic search, <100ms end-to-end execution  
**Timeline**: 4 weeks from foundation to optimization

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

### go-kernal Core Development
**Days 1-3: Pure Syscall Interface**
- File system operations (create, read, write, delete, permissions)

- Network operations (basic connectivity, status)
- System information (resources, platform detection)

**Days 4-5: CLI Interface**
```go
// Target interface design
go-kernal --subsystem=fs --operation=create --path="/file" --content="data"
go-kernal --subsystem=proc --operation=start --cmd="npm" --args="install"
go-kernal --batch="fs.create:/file1:content1,proc.start:npm:install"
```

**Days 6-7: Security & Validation**

## Technical Architecture Specifications

### go-kernal Design
```go
type Kernel interface {
    FS() FileSystem     // File operations
    Proc() ProcessManager  // Process control  
    Mem() MemoryManager   // Memory operations

    Sys() SystemInfo     // System information
}
```

### go-agent Design  
```go
type Agent interface {
    Semantic() SemanticEngine    // Intent to workflow
    Context() ContextManager     // FlowMind integration
    Router() RouterLLM          // Fast semantic routing

### Communication Protocol
```go
type WorkflowRequest struct {
    Intent     string            // Natural language intent
    Context    map[string]interface{} // User/project context
    Constraints []string         // Constitutional limits
}

type ExecutionResult struct {
    Success    bool             // Operation success
