    T, H, W, C = video_tensor.shape
    
    # Sample 3D cuboids for masking
    cuboid_size = (4, 16, 16)  # temporal, height, width
    num_patches = (T // 4) * (H // 16) * (W // 16)
    masked_patches = sample_random_patches(num_patches, mask_ratio)
    
    return apply_3d_mask(video_tensor, masked_patches)
```
