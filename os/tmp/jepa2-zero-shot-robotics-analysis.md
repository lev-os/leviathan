## Technical Mechanisms Enabling Zero-Shot Transfer

### Two-Stage Training Architecture
```
Stage 1: Self-Supervised Pretraining
├── Input: 1M+ hours internet video
├── Objective: Spatio-temporal prediction
├── Learning: Universal world dynamics
└── Output: Foundation world model

Stage 2: Action-Conditioned Fine-tuning  
├── Input: 62 hours robot interaction data
├── Objective: Action-effect correlation
├── Learning: Embodied control mapping
└── Output: Robotic control capability
```

### Zero-Shot Transfer Mechanisms
1. **Universal World Model**: Pre-trained representations generalize across domains
2. **Action Conditioning**: Minimal robot data enables control understanding
3. **Visual Goal Specification**: Tasks defined through goal images, not programming
4. **Energy Landscape Optimization**: MPC uses prediction error for action selection

### Technical Implementation
```python
# Conceptual zero-shot control pipeline
def zero_shot_control(current_state, goal_image, world_model):
    candidate_actions = sample_action_space()
    
    best_action = None
    min_energy = float('inf')
    
    for action in candidate_actions:
        predicted_state = world_model.predict(current_state, action)
        energy = compute_energy(predicted_state, goal_image)
        
        if energy < min_energy:
            min_energy = energy
            best_action = action
    
    return best_action
```

## Goal Conditioning Architecture

### Visual Goal Specification
- **Input Modality**: Goal images instead of coordinates or scripts
- **Semantic Understanding**: High-level visual reasoning about objectives
- **Flexible Specification**: Natural way to define tasks for non-experts

### Energy-Based Model Predictive Control
```
Current State + Action → World Model → Predicted State
                                           ↓
Goal Image ←← Energy Function ←← Predicted State
     ↓
Optimization Loop → Best Action
```

### Implementation Details
- **Energy Function**: L2 distance in embedding space between prediction and goal
- **Optimization**: Iterative action sampling and energy minimization
- **Temporal Horizon**: Multi-step lookahead for complex tasks
- **Local Convexity**: Smooth energy landscape enables robust optimization
