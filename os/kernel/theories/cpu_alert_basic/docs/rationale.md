# CPU Alert Basic - Theory Rationale

## Why This Approach?

### Conservative Strategy Selection
This theory implements a **conservative CPU monitoring approach** as the foundation for AI self-learning research. The rationale for this choice:

1. **Proven Reliability**: Uses well-established monitoring methods (`/proc/loadavg`)
2. **Low Risk**: Minimal system impact and straightforward implementation
3. **Clear Success Criteria**: Easy to measure and validate performance
4. **Learning Foundation**: Provides baseline for more advanced theories

### Design Philosophy

#### Safety First
- **System Stability**: Never compromise system performance while monitoring
- **Graceful Degradation**: Multiple fallback methods ensure continued operation
- **Resource Limits**: Self-imposed constraints (< 2% CPU, < 50MB memory)
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with automatic cleanup

#### Simplicity Over Sophistication
- **Single Threshold**: Clear 80% CPU trigger point, no complex algorithms
- **Direct Detection**: Immediate response rather than predictive analysis
- **Standard Tools**: Uses common Linux utilities and Python standard library
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Works with basic system tools

### Theory vs Practice Analysis

#### What We Expect
- **Response Time**: Alert delivery within 1 second of threshold breach
- **Accuracy**: CPU detection within ±2% of actual usage
- **Reliability**: 99%+ uptime without crashes or hangs
- **Resource Usage**: Monitoring overhead under 2% CPU, 50MB memory

#### Potential Gotchas (Devil's Advocate)
1. **Load Average ≠ CPU Usage**: `/proc/loadavg` measures system load, not instantaneous CPU
2. **Desktop Environment Dependency**: GUI notifications may fail in different environments  
3. **Permission Issues**: Some monitoring methods might require elevated privileges
4. **Timing Precision**: 5-second sampling interval may miss brief CPU spikes

#### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Load Average Limitation**: Acceptable for threshold detection, more accurate than complex alternatives
2. **Notification Fallbacks**: Multiple notification methods (notify-send → zenity → terminal output)
3. **Standard User Mode**: All operations designed to work with normal user permissions
4. **Sampling Trade-off**: 5-second interval balances responsiveness with system impact

### Success Criteria Justification

#### Performance Targets
```yaml
response_time: "< 1.0 seconds"     # Fast enough for user awareness
detection_accuracy: "> 0.95"      # High reliability for threshold detection
system_stability: "no_degradation" # Zero impact on normal operations
resource_usage: "< 2% cpu, < 50MB" # Minimal monitoring overhead
```

#### Why These Specific Numbers?
- **1 Second Response**: User expectation for immediate feedback
- **95% Accuracy**: Allows for system measurement variations
- **2% CPU Limit**: Imperceptible impact on system performance
- **50MB Memory**: Reasonable for simple monitoring process

### Learning Objectives

This conservative theory serves specific learning goals:

1. **Baseline Establishment**: Create reliable foundation for comparison
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify basic syscall patterns that work
3. **Context Understanding**: Learn desktop environment constraints
4. **Failure Modes**: Discover edge cases and error conditions

### Expected Evolution Path

#### Successful Patterns to Extract
- Effective CPU measurement techniques
