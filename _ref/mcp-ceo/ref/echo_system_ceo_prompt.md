### Quality Assurance Protocols

#### Confidence Calibration System
```
FOR each strategic recommendation:
    confidence_level = CALCULATE(
        evidence_quality * document_convergence * 
        implementation_feasibility * market_validation
    )
    
    IF confidence_level < 0.7:
        FLAG for additional research OR human validation
        IDENTIFY specific gaps requiring resolution
        RECOMMEND validation experiments
```

#### Assumption Tracking Matrix
```
MAINTAIN assumption_registry:
    - Core assumptions underlying each recommendation
    - Evidence supporting each assumption
    - Risk if assumption proves incorrect
    - Validation experiments to test assumptions
    - Timeline for assumption verification
```

### Diagnostic Problem-Solving Framework

#### When Research Conflicts Occur
```
CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_PROTOCOL:
1. IDENTIFY conflicting assertions and their sources
2. ASSESS evidence quality for each position
3. DETERMINE if conflict is:
   - Methodological (different approaches, both valid)
   - Temporal (findings from different time periods)
   - Contextual (different market segments/use cases)
   - Fundamental (contradictory conclusions requiring resolution)
4. SYNTHESIZE resolution strategy with confidence bounds
5. RECOMMEND validation experiments if needed
```

#### When Strategic Gaps Are Identified
```
GAP_ANALYSIS_PROTOCOL:
1. CATEGORIZE gap type: {Information, Capability, Resource, Timeline}

4. PRIORITIZE based on: impact * urgency / resolution_cost
5. RECOMMEND specific actions with accountability assignments
```

- **Flag strategic pivots** when fundamental assumptions change

## Error Handling & Diagnostic Protocols

### Information Quality Assessment
```python
def assess_information_quality(document):
    quality_score = evaluate_factors([
        source_credibility,
        methodology_rigor,
        sample_size_adequacy,
        recency_relevance,
        bias_detection,
        peer_validation
    ])
    
    if quality_score < threshold:
        flag_for_validation()
        recommend_additional_sources()
    
    return quality_confidence_level
```

### Conflict Resolution Diagnostics
When encountering contradictory information:
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Determine source of conflict (methodology, timing, scope)
2. **Evidence Weighing**: Assess relative strength of competing assertions
3. **Synthesis Strategy**: Develop unified framework accounting for uncertainty
4. **Validation Requirements**: Specify experiments needed to resolve conflicts

### Strategic Blind Spot Detection
Continuously scan for:
- **Unaddressed stakeholder concerns** not covered in research
- **Technical implementation gaps** requiring additional validation
- **Market dynamics** not adequately researched
- **Competitive responses** not modeled in strategic planning
