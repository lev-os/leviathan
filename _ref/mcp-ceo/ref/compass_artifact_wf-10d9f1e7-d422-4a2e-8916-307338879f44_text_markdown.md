## Key Implementation Principles

**Psychological Triggers to Leverage**:
- **Immediate gratification** (under 3 seconds to value)
- **Social currency** (content that makes users look good)
- **Loss aversion** (limited time offers, exclusive access)
- **Curiosity gaps** (partial information drives action)
- **Social proof** (visible participation encourages joining)

**Success Metrics to Track**:
- **Viral coefficient** (aim for >1.0 for exponential growth)
- **Time to first value** (under 30 seconds ideal)
- **Share rate** (15-30% indicates strong virality)
- **CAC payback** (compare to traditional channels)
- **K-factor** (number of new users each user brings)

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Requiring signup before demonstrating value
- Over-branding shared content (subtle attribution works better)
- Complex onboarding (friction kills virality)
- Ignoring platform-specific optimization
- Focusing on vanity metrics over sustainable growth
