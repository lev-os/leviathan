      "response": "As CORTISOL GUARDIAN: I sense deep alignment here - building an AI startup specifically focused on reducing global stress is the ultimate cortisol-reduction mission. The core challenge is creating a sustainable business model that scales stress reduction rather than stress creation. This matters because most startups increase founder and user stress through growth-at-all-costs mentalities. Success looks like: profitable unit economics from day one, users reporting measurable stress reduction, and a team culture that models low-stress high-performance work.\n\nAs SYSTEMS ILLUMINATOR: The elegant system design emerges - an AI startup that uses its own product to reduce operational stress while helping others do the same. The recursive loop is powerful: less stressed founders make better decisions, build better products, attract better talent, and create better outcomes. The key insight is that sustainability and stress reduction are not constraints but accelerators. By optimizing for calm, focused execution rather than frantic pivoting, you create compound advantages.\n\nSynthesis: Your sustainable AI startup should embody the change it seeks to create - demonstrating that high performance and low stress are not opposites but synergistic forces that amplify each other."
