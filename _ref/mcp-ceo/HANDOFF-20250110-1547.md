# CONTEXT HANDOFF - MCP-CEO PROJECT

## üéØ PROJECT STATUS SNAPSHOT
**Project**: MCP-CEO FlowMind Bidirectional Reasoning Engine
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-10 15:47
**Session Duration**: 45+ minutes
**Context Burn**: 75%

## üö¶ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### Core FlowMind System
- üü† **PARTIALLY BUILT** - Base class exists, tests failing
  - File: `src/flowmind.js` - Core FlowMind class with YAML loading
  - File: `src/context-assembler.js` - Context loading and assembly
  - File: `src/assembly-rules.js` - Context combination logic
  - Dependencies: YAML files in contexts/ directory

### MCP Server Integration
- üü° **DESIGNED** - Protocol defined, implementation incomplete
  - File: `server.js` - MCP server with workflow endpoints
  - File: `mcp-client.js` - Client for testing
  - Dependencies: MCP protocol compliance

### Test Suite
- üî¥ **FAILING** - 49 failing tests, architectural mismatch
  - File: `tests/unit/assembly-rules.spec.js` - Core logic tests
  - File: `tests/integration/real-usage.spec.js` - End-to-end tests
  - Dependencies: Vitest test runner

## üìç CURRENT STATE

### What Actually Exists (CODE ON DISK)
```
File: src/flowmind.js
Status: üü† PARTIALLY BUILT
Purpose: Core FlowMind class with 1:1 YAML mapping
Dependencies: fs, path, yaml library

File: contexts/agents/ceo/context.yaml
Status: ‚úÖ TESTED
Purpose: Example agent context definition
Dependencies: None - pure YAML

File: tests/unit/assembly-rules.spec.js
Status: üî¥ FAILING
Purpose: Tests for context combination logic
Dependencies: Vitest, expects different architecture than implemented
```

### What Was Accomplished This Session
1. Identified architectural mismatch - Tests expect normalization, code does 1:1 YAML mapping
2. Confirmed YAML-first approach is correct per constitutional framework
3. Located 49 failing tests that need updates, not code fixes
4. Verified core FlowMind class loads YAML correctly

### Critical Understanding
The FlowMind system is designed for bidirectional LLM-MCP communication where the LLM IS the runtime, not just a text processor. Tests were written expecting traditional object normalization, but the correct approach is 1:1 YAML mapping to preserve semantic structure for LLM reasoning.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ASSUMPTIONS TO AVOID
- ‚ùå Don't assume tests are correct - they expect wrong architecture
- ‚ùå Don't try to normalize YAML - preserve structure for LLM reasoning
- ‚ùå Don't build traditional inheritance hierarchies - everything is FlowMind with type property
- ‚ùå Don't mock LLM reasoning in tests - leave TODOs for bidirectional integration

## üé¨ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Action (< 5 min)
```bash
# Verify current test failures
npm test

# Check FlowMind class loads correctly
node -e "const FlowMind = require('./src/flowmind.js'); console.log(new FlowMind({type: 'test'}).type)"
```

### Continue Work
1. Update failing tests to match 1:1 YAML mapping architecture
2. Remove normalization expectations from test assertions
3. Add integration test for MCP server workflow execution
4. Test bidirectional flow with actual MCP calls

### Test Current Implementation
```bash
# Test core FlowMind functionality
node -e "
const FlowMind = require('./src/flowmind.js');
const context = FlowMind.loadFromPath('./contexts/agents/ceo/context.yaml');
console.log('Loaded:', context.metadata?.name || 'unnamed');
console.log('Type:', context.type || 'no type');
"
```

## üóÇÔ∏è KEY FILES
Only list files that next AI MUST read:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Constitutional framework and LLM-first principles
- `src/flowmind.js` - Current implementation of core class
- `contexts/agents/ceo/context.yaml` - Example of expected YAML structure

## üö´ DON'T READ THESE
Files that seem relevant but aren't:
- `docs/adr/*.md` - Design documents, not current implementation
- `tests/fixtures/` - Test data, not core understanding
- `archive/` - Old implementations, will confuse current approach
- `book/` - Future vision, not current implementation

**Handoff Protocol**: Tests need to be fixed to match superior YAML-first architecture, not vice versa
