# FlowMind Context Enhancement Plan
## Strategic Framework for Advanced Context System Evolution

### Executive Summary

This plan outlines a comprehensive enhancement strategy for the FlowMind context system, building upon the solid foundation of 57+ existing contexts across 8 categories. The enhancement leverages advanced prompt engineering techniques from the user's custom system (referenced as "~/t" techniques) to create a world-class intelligent context orchestration platform.

## 1. Current State Analysis

### Context Directory Inventory (57+ Files)
```
agents/         - 15 files (8 EEPS personalities, specialized agents)
patterns/       - 23 files (thinking frameworks, methodologies)
workflows/      - 9 files (multi-step processes)
types/          - 8 files (project classification systems)
tools/          - 2 files (utility contexts)
themes/         - 2 files (interaction styles)
preferences/    - 1 file (user experience configs)
templates/      - 5 files (EEPS agent templates)
```

### Architecture Strengths Identified
- **YAML-First Design**: Configuration-driven approach enables rapid iteration
- **Template Separation**: Clean separation of structure (YAML) and content (Markdown)
- **Context Switching**: Multi-agent workflow pattern is architecturally sound
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating despite missing contexts

### Current Issues Requiring Resolution
1. **Context Registry Bug**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')` error
2. **Missing Contexts**: 49+ contexts referenced but not found
3. **Template Migration**: 17 remaining agents with embedded prompts need conversion
4. **Inconsistent Validation**: No unified validation framework

## 2. Enhancement Opportunities Using Advanced Prompt Techniques
