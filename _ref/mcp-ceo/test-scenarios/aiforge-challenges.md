# AIForge Architecture Challenges - Test Scenarios for MCP-CEO

Based on analysis of AIForge projects (ChooseHealthy, EchoCanvas, Kingly), here are additional architectural challenges.

## 1. Three-Layer Architecture Enforcement

**Challenge**: "In ChooseHealthy, we enforce strict separation: Services (data) → Hooks (logic) → Components (UI). But developers keep putting Firebase calls in components for 'quick fixes.' How do we balance architectural purity with developer velocity?"

**Context**:
- Services: Pure data operations
- Hooks: Business logic orchestration  
- Components: NO database access allowed
- Developers complain about "too many files"
- Quick prototypes become permanent code

**Expected Analysis**: Technical architecture review + team psychology assessment

## 2. Offline-First vs Cloud-Native Tension

**Challenge**: "ChooseHealthy needs offline support for food tracking, but we're using Firebase everywhere. Should we add a complex sync layer or accept that some features require internet?"

**Context**:
- Users track meals without connectivity
- Firebase requires online for most operations
- Sync conflicts are complex to resolve
- Battery life concerns with background sync

**Expected Approach**: User needs analysis + technical feasibility study

## 3. Module Boundaries in EchoCanvas

**Challenge**: "EchoCanvas uses a module system where each feature is isolated. But features need to communicate - should we use a central event bus, feature coordinators, or actor model?"

**Context**:
- Canvas module needs to notify multiple features
- Event bus feels like global state anti-pattern
- Feature coordinators add complexity
- Actor model might be overkill

**Expected Analysis**: Scaling assessment + complexity evaluation

## 4. Performance Budget Decisions

**Challenge**: "EchoCanvas prioritizes perceived performance with optimistic UI, but this creates complexity when operations fail. Should we keep the optimistic approach or move to more traditional loading states?"

**Context**:
- Optimistic UI feels fast but can confuse on errors
- Traditional loading is clear but feels slow
- Rollback logic is complex
- User expectations from consumer apps

**Expected Workflow**: User psychology analysis + error handling strategy

## 5. State Management Proliferation

**Challenge**: "We use useState for simple state, useReducer for complex local state, Zustand for cross-component state, and React Hook Form for forms. Is this too many patterns or good separation of concerns?"

**Context**:
- Each tool fits its use case perfectly
- New developers struggle with which to use
- Testing strategies differ per approach
- Migration between patterns is painful

**Expected Analysis**: Cognitive load assessment + standardization benefits

## 6. Feature Flag Architecture

**Challenge**: "Both projects need feature flags for A/B testing and gradual rollouts. Should we build our own system, use a service like LaunchDarkly, or leverage Firebase Remote Config?"

**Context**:
- Need both client and server-side flags
- Cost considerations for external services
- Firebase already in our stack
- Need developer-friendly experience

**Expected Approach**: Build vs buy analysis + integration complexity

## 7. Monorepo vs Multi-repo for AIForge

**Challenge**: "AIForge has multiple apps (ChooseHealthy, EchoCanvas, Kingly) with shared components. Should we move to a monorepo or keep separate repos with published packages?"

**Context**:
- Shared UI components across projects
- Different deployment cycles
- Team boundaries and ownership
- CI/CD complexity in both approaches

**Expected Analysis**: Team structure impact + technical benefits assessment

## 8. Authentication Strategy Across Apps

**Challenge**: "Each AIForge app uses Firebase Auth differently. Should we create a unified auth service or let each app manage its own auth?"

**Context**:
- Single sign-on desire across apps
- Different permission models per app
- Firebase Auth limitations
- Security boundary concerns

**Expected Workflow**: Security analysis + user experience design

## 9. React Native vs Next.js Decision

**Challenge**: "ChooseHealthy is React Native for mobile, EchoCanvas is Next.js for web. Users want both. Should we: 1) Add React Native Web, 2) Make responsive Next.js apps, or 3) Maintain separate codebases?"

**Context**:
- Native features needed (camera, LiDAR)
- SEO important for web versions
- Team expertise varies
- Maintenance burden concerns

**Expected Analysis**: Platform strategy + resource allocation

## 10. AI Integration Architecture

**Challenge**: "All AIForge apps need AI features. Should we create a central AI service, embed AI in each app, or use a hybrid approach?"

**Context**:
- OpenAI costs need optimization
- Response time requirements vary
- Privacy concerns with central service
- Model selection differs per use case

**Expected Approach**: Cost analysis + privacy assessment + architecture design
