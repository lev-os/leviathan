# General Software Architecture Challenges - Test Scenarios for MCP-CEO

These challenges test the MCP-CEO system with common architectural decisions that stress different perspectives.

## 1. Microservices vs Monolith for Startup

**Challenge**: "We're a 5-person startup building a SaaS product. Should we start with microservices for future scale or a monolith for speed? We have 6 months of runway."

**Context**:
- Limited resources (time and people)
- Unknown product-market fit
- Investors asking about "scale"
- Team has mixed experience levels

**Expected Analysis**: Bootstrap assessment + strategic runway planning

## 2. Database Choice Paralysis

**Challenge**: "Choosing between PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and DynamoDB for our new app. It needs to handle user profiles, time-series data, and complex relationships. What guides this decision?"

**Context**:
- ACID requirements for financial data
- Time-series for analytics
- Graph-like social features
- Cost concerns at scale
- Team knows SQL best

**Expected Workflow**: Requirements analysis â†’ technology mapping

## 3. Real-time Sync Architecture

**Challenge**: "Building a collaborative editor like Figma. Should we use CRDTs, Operational Transformation, or a simpler last-write-wins with conflict resolution?"

**Context**:
- Need <100ms perceived latency
- Multiple users editing simultaneously  
- Offline support required
- Complex formatting and embedded objects
- Bootstrap budget constraints

**Expected Analysis**: Technical deep dive + user experience impact

## 4. API Versioning Strategy

**Challenge**: "Our API has 100+ endpoints and 50+ clients. How do we evolve it without breaking things? Version in URL, headers, or GraphQL-style evolution?"

**Context**:
- Legacy clients can't update
- Need rapid feature development
- Documentation burden growing
- Support costs increasing
- Multiple client platforms

**Expected Approach**: Migration strategy + support cost analysis

## 5. Security vs Usability Tradeoff

**Challenge**: "Users complain our security is too strict (2FA, session timeouts, password requirements). How do we balance security with user experience?"

**Context**:
- B2B SaaS with sensitive data
- Competitors have easier login
- Support tickets about lockouts
- SOC2 compliance required
- Consumer-like UX expectations

**Expected Analysis**: Risk assessment + user psychology evaluation

## 6. Build vs Buy Core Infrastructure

**Challenge**: "Should we build our own job queue, use Redis + Bull, or pay for a service like Temporal? We process 1M+ jobs daily."

**Context**:
- Current solution hitting limits
- Need reliability guarantees
- Cost at scale concerns
- Team wants to build
- Time to market pressure

**Expected Workflow**: Total cost of ownership analysis

## 7. Frontend Framework Migration

**Challenge**: "Our React app is 5 years old with class components and Redux. Do we gradually migrate to hooks and modern state management or rewrite in Next.js?"

**Context**:
- 200+ components
- Active development ongoing
- Performance issues mounting
- Hiring challenges with old stack
- SEO becoming important

**Expected Approach**: Risk analysis + phased migration planning

## 8. Data Privacy Architecture

**Challenge**: "GDPR requires data deletion but we need audit logs. How do we architect for both compliance and business needs?"

**Context**:
- Financial audit requirements
- Right to be forgotten requests
- Data analysis needs
- Backup complexity
- Cross-border data flow

**Expected Analysis**: Legal compliance + technical architecture

## 9. Monitoring vs Privacy

**Challenge**: "We need error monitoring and analytics but users are privacy-conscious. How much telemetry is too much?"

**Context**:
- Can't debug without error details
- Users upset about tracking
- Competitors tout privacy
- Support costs without data
- GDPR/CCPA compliance

**Expected Workflow**: Privacy-first design + support strategy

## 10. Technical Debt Prioritization

**Challenge**: "We have 6 months of technical debt: old dependencies, no tests, poor documentation. Feature development is slowing. How do we prioritize?"

**Context**:
- Revenue pressure for features
- Bugs increasing exponentially  
- Team morale declining
- Onboarding takes months
- Customer churn from bugs

**Expected Analysis**: Business impact assessment + team health evaluation

## Testing Focus

- Test how CEO handles time/resource constraints
- Evaluate synthesis of technical and business concerns
- Check for pragmatic vs idealistic recommendations
- Assess consideration of human factors
- Verify bootstrap-friendly approaches

## Success Metrics

- Actionable recommendations
- Clear prioritization frameworks
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Phased implementation plans
- Team sustainability considered
