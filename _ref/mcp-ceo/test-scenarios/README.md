# MCP-CEO Test Scenarios

This directory contains real-world architectural challenges extracted from the Kingly and AIForge codebases, designed to test the MCP-CEO multi-personality decision system.

## Test Collections

### 1. [Kingly Architecture Challenges](./kingly-challenges.md)
Real challenges from the Kingly LLM-first agent system:
- LLM-first philosophy decisions
- Memory system architecture (Graphiti vs Ultimate MCP)
- Relationship system design
- Plugin quality control
- Batch operations vs conversational purity
- Context inheritance complexity
- Direct adapter patterns

### 2. [AIForge Architecture Challenges](./aiforge-challenges.md)
Challenges from AIForge projects (ChooseHealthy, EchoCanvas):
- Three-layer architecture enforcement
- Offline-first vs cloud-native
- Module communication patterns
- State management proliferation
- React Native vs Next.js decisions
- AI service architecture

### 3. [General Architecture Challenges](./general-architecture-challenges.md)
Common software architecture decisions:
- Microservices vs monolith
- Database selection
- Real-time collaboration
- API versioning
- Security vs usability
- Build vs buy decisions
- Technical debt prioritization

## How to Use These Tests

1. **Single Challenge Test**:
   ```
   "Use architect_of_abundance to help with: [paste specific challenge]"
   ```

2. **Workflow Test**:
   ```
   "Use architect_of_abundance with document_synthesis workflow for: [challenge with multiple docs]"
   ```

3. **Bootstrap Test**:
   ```
   "Use bootstrap_assessment for: [challenge about scaling from minimal resources]"
   ```

## What to Evaluate

1. **Personality Activation**: Which personalities activate based on keywords?
2. **Synthesis Quality**: How well are multiple perspectives integrated?
3. **Practical Advice**: Are recommendations actionable?
4. **Stress Reduction**: Is the cortisol-reducing approach evident?
5. **Bootstrap Philosophy**: Do solutions scale from Raspberry Pi to cloud?

## Expected Behaviors

- **Legal challenges** → Legal personality activates
- **Team conflicts** → Psychology personality engages
- **Technical complexity** → Technical architect provides clarity
- **Resource constraints** → Bootstrap sovereignty analysis
- **Multiple documents** → Document synthesis workflow triggers

## Success Criteria

✅ Clear, actionable recommendations
✅ Multiple perspectives considered naturally
✅ Complexity explained simply
✅ Phased implementation approaches
✅ Human factors addressed
✅ Bootstrap-first thinking evident
✅ Stress reduction throughout

## Notes

- These are real challenges from active codebases
- Each challenge has enough context to be meaningful
- Expected analyses/workflows are suggestions, not requirements
- The system should adapt its approach based on the challenge
- Hidden complexity (multi-personality) should not be exposed to users
