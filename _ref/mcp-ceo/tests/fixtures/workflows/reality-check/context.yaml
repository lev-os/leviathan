    TechCorp AI is considering launching their revolutionary "FlowMind Assistant" - 
    an AI agent orchestration platform that competes directly with Claude Code, 
    Cursor, and Windsurf. The decision has complex technical, business, competitive, 
    and strategic implications across multiple stakeholders and timeframes.
