## ADR Collection

### Phase 1: Foundation Architecture (ADRs 000-001)

#### ADR-000: FlowMind Interface Specification
**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Innovation:** 1:1 YAML-to-Interface Mapping with Semantic Enhancement

**The Problem:**
Traditional AI systems force developers to choose between sophisticated YAML configurations and simple programmatic interfaces. FlowMind's existing YAML structures were rich and well-designed, but the interface layer oversimplified them, losing semantic richness.

**The Breakthrough:**
Instead of dumbing down superior YAML to match broken tests, elevate the interface to honor and expose the full richness of the YAML structure through intelligent accessors.

**Key Innovation:**
```javascript
class FlowMind {
  // 1:1 YAML mapping preserves all semantic richness
  get name() { return this._metadata.name }
  get capabilities() { return this._config.capabilities }
  
  // Intelligent accessors add programming convenience
  hasCapability(capability) {
    return this._config.capabilities?.includes(capability)
  }
  
  // Semantic evaluation hooks enable natural language conditions
  async shouldTriggerWorkflow(workflowName, context) {
    return await this._evaluateSemanticConditions(
      workflow.auto_trigger_conditions, 
      context
    )
  }
}
```

**Impact:**
- Established FlowMind as the bridge between sophisticated YAML and intelligent interfaces
- Created foundation for semantic workflow orchestration
- Enabled preservation of YAML as the single source of truth
- Set architectural pattern for semantic enhancement without losing deterministic access

**Lessons Learned:**
- Complex YAML structures should drive interface design, not limit it
- Intelligent accessors can bridge human-readable configuration and programmatic efficiency
- 1:1 mappings preserve semantic richness while enabling future enhancement---

#### ADR-000: FlowMind Roadmap
**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Innovation:** Isolated Task Analysis for Parallel Development

**The Problem:**
With 49 failing tests and a complex architecture to implement, development could easily become chaotic without clear task isolation and dependency management.

**The Solution:**
Comprehensive task isolation analysis that identified fully independent tasks (can be built in parallel) versus dependent tasks (require sequential development).

**Key Insight:**
```bash
# Fully Isolated Tasks (Parallel Development)
- FlowMind Base Classes (No dependencies)
- YAML Type Detection Logic (Pure logic)
- Test Data Fixtures (Data creation only)

# Dependent Tasks (Sequential Development)  
- ContextAssembler Integration (Needs FlowMind classes)
- Test Suite Updates (Needs working integration)
- Semantic Framework (Needs solid foundation)
```

**Impact:**
- Enabled efficient parallel development by multiple contributors
- Reduced implementation risk through clear dependency management
- Established phase-based development with clear success criteria
- Created foundation for the two-week implementation sprint

**Implementation Strategy:**
Week 1 focused on foundation with all tests passing, Week 2 added intelligence layer, Week 3+ enabled semantic enhancement.

#### ADR-001: Prompt Component Extraction and Organization
**Status:** PROPOSED  
**Innovation:** Hierarchical Component Library for Reusable AI Prompts

**The Context:**
MCP-CEO had accumulated various system prompts embedded in configuration files and scattered across directories. Dynamic context assembly required these to be extracted into a structured, reusable library.

**The Decision:**
Create a hierarchical prompt component library organized by function:
- `personalities/` - Individual personality prompts
- `phases/` - Reusable workflow phases  
- `experts/` - Domain expert templates
- `patterns/` - Common prompt patterns
- `outputs/` - Output format templates

**Architectural Principle:**
Transform embedded prompt strings into a composable component library where complex AI behaviors emerge from combining simple, well-tested components.

**Benefits:**
- **Modularity**: Single component reused across multiple workflows
- **Testability**: Individual components can be validated independently
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for each prompt pattern
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new components and combinations

**Future Impact:**
This ADR established the foundational principle that would enable FlowMind's dynamic prompt synthesis - the ability to combine multiple prompt components at runtime based on semantic conditions.---

### Phase 2: Core Engine Architecture (ADRs 002-006)

#### ADR-002-v2: Context Assembler Core Architecture (UPDATED)
**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Innovation:** Protocol-Based Context Assembly with Auto-Discovery

**The Evolution:**
ADR-002 v1 proposed personality mappings and configuration files. After protocol analysis, v2 **eliminated mappings entirely** through self-organizing context discovery.

**Revolutionary Change:**
```javascript
// v1: Configuration-heavy approach
const assembler = new ContextAssembler({
  contextRoot: './contexts',
  mappings: './personality-mappings.yaml' // ELIMINATED
})

// v2: Zero-configuration protocol approach  
const assembler = new ContextAssembler({
  contextRoot: './contexts'
  // NO mappings - auto-discovery instead
})

const result = await assembler.load('agent://cortisol_guardian')
```

**Protocol Innovation:**
Universal addressing format: `{protocol}://{path}#{fragment}?{query}`
- `agent://cortisol_guardian` - Auto-discovered from metadata
- `file://contexts/custom/my-agent.yaml` - Direct file access
- `markdown://prompts/system-base.md` - Prompt templates
- `script://generators/dynamic.js?version=1.2` - Dynamic generation

**Key Benefits:**
- **Zero Configuration**: No setup files needed
- **Self-Organizing**: Contexts describe their own addressing
- **User Sovereignty**: Custom protocols always override core
- **Intuitive Addressing**: URIs that "just work"

**Architectural Impact:**
This decision eliminated the complexity of managing mapping files while enabling infinite extensibility through user-defined protocols.

---

#### ADR-003-v2: Protocol Registry System (UPDATED)
**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Innovation:** Unified Protocol Registry with User Override

**The Refinement:**
ADR-003 v1 proposed separate loader registries. Analysis revealed that protocols should handle their own loading logic, leading to a unified approach.

**Unified Design:**
```javascript
class ProtocolRegistry {
  constructor() {
    this.coreProtocols = new Map()
    this.userProtocols = new Map() // Takes precedence
    this.registerCoreProtocols()
  }
  
  registerProtocol(name, handler) {
    this.userProtocols.set(name, handler) // User always wins
  }
}
```

**User Sovereignty Principle:**
Any user-defined protocol automatically overrides core implementations, ensuring complete customization capability without modifying core system.

**Standard URI Semantics:**
Correct implementation of URI format with fragment and query support, following web standards everyone understands.**Impact:**
- Simplified architecture through unified protocol handling
- Guaranteed user override capability for any protocol
- Standard URI semantics for intuitive addressing
- Foundation for enterprise and personal customization

---

#### ADR-004: Prompt Assembler Engine
**Status:** APPROVED  
**Innovation:** Intelligent Prompt Assembly with Template System

**The Challenge:**
Converting rich context data into optimized system prompts required intelligent synthesis of personality cores, step contexts, previous results, and instructions.

**The Solution:**
Modular prompt assembly engine with template system and context synthesis:

```javascript
class PromptAssembler {
  async assemble(contextData, stepConfig, previousResults) {
    const sections = await Promise.all([
      this.buildHeader(contextData.metadata),
      this.buildCorePrompt(contextData),
      this.buildStepContext(stepConfig),
      this.buildPreviousContext(previousResults),
      this.buildInstructions(stepConfig)
    ])
    
    return this.synthesizer.combine(sections.filter(Boolean))
  }
}
```

**Template Innovation:**
- `personality-base.template` - Core personality prompt structure
- `step-instructions.template` - Step-specific guidance patterns
- `previous-context.template` - Integration of prior results
- Custom templates for project-specific needs

**Context Synthesis Rules:**
1. **Personality Core** - Convert YAML agent_config to coherent prompt
2. **Step Integration** - Inject step-specific instructions seamlessly
3. **History Awareness** - Include relevant previous results
4. **Token Optimization** - Compress for LLM efficiency
5. **Constitutional Validation** - Ensure core principles maintained

**Future Foundation:**
This ADR established the engine that would later enable FlowMind's dynamic prompt synthesis - the ability to generate prompts at runtime based on semantic conditions.

---

#### ADR-005: Interface Specification
**Status:** APPROVED  
**Innovation:** Clean, Stable Interfaces for Ecosystem Integration

**The Design Philosophy:**
Create minimal, powerful interfaces that hide complexity while enabling infinite extensibility.

**Primary API:**
```javascript
import { ContextAssembler } from '@kingly/core'

const assembler = new ContextAssembler({
  contextRoot: './contexts'
})

const result = await assembler.assemble({
  personality: 'cortisol_guardian',
  step: 1,
  previousResults: {...},
  context: {...}
})
```**Extension Architecture:**
```javascript
// Register custom loaders
assembler.registerLoader('custom', new CustomLoader())

// Register protocol handlers  
assembler.registerProtocol('api', new APIProtocolHandler())

// Add template transformers
assembler.addTransformer('optimize', new TokenOptimizer())
```

**Interface Stability Guarantee:**
- No breaking changes to public API
- All extensions via registration pattern
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Performance benchmarks enforced

**Ecosystem Impact:**
This specification enabled clean integration with larger Kingly ecosystem while providing stable foundation for third-party extensions.

---

#### ADR-006: Protocol Auto-Discovery System
**Status:** APPROVED  
**Innovation:** Intelligent Context Self-Organization

**The Breakthrough:**
Contexts self-describe their addressing through metadata, eliminating need for central configuration files.

**Self-Description Pattern:**
```yaml
# contexts/agents/eeps/sfj-caregiver/context.yaml
metadata:
  type: "agent"
  id: "sfj-caregiver"
  protocols:
    - "agent://cortisol_guardian"
    - "agent://stress_reduction"
    - "agent://eeps/sfj-caregiver"
  aliases: ["cortisol_guardian", "stress_guardian"]
```

**Auto-Discovery Engine:**
```javascript
class AgentProtocol {
  async buildIndex() {
    const contexts = await this.scanContexts('./contexts/agents')
    for (const context of contexts) {
      // Index all declared protocols
      for (const protocol of context.metadata.protocols || []) {
        this.index.set(protocol, context.path)
      }
      // Index all aliases
      for (const alias of context.metadata.aliases || []) {
        this.aliases.set(alias, context.path)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Revolutionary Benefits:**
1. **Zero Configuration** - No mapping files needed
2. **Multiple Addresses** - One context, many ways to reach it
3. **Fuzzy Matching** - `cortisol` automatically matches `cortisol_guardian`
4. **Self-Organizing** - System discovers structure automatically

**Paradigm Shift:**
From centrally managed configuration to distributed self-organization, enabling systems that scale from personal use to enterprise deployment without configuration overhead.---

### Phase 3: Semantic Revolution (ADRs 007-008)

#### ADR-007: FlowMind Semantic-Aware Control Flow Language
**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Innovation:** World's First Semantic Control Flow Language

**The Problem:**
AI workflows were trapped between rigid programming (deterministic but inflexible) and chaotic prompting (flexible but unpredictable). No existing tool bridged human intent with machine precision.

**The Breakthrough:**
FlowMind enables natural language conditions alongside traditional logic:

```yaml
flowmind:
  flow:
    # Traditional logic
    - if: "context.tier == 'premium'"
      then:
        include: "ref/patterns/premium_support.md"
        
    # Semantic reasoning  
    - when_semantic: "user is angry OR very frustrated"
      confidence_threshold: 0.8
      then:
        include: "ref/patterns/de_escalation.md"
        
    # Mixed conditions
    - if: "context.issue_count > 3" 
      and_semantic: "user seems ready to churn"
      then:
        workflow: "retention_specialist"
```

**Revolutionary Features:**
1. **Semantic Control Flow**: `when_semantic: "user seems frustrated"`
2. **Dynamic Prompt Synthesis**: Runtime generation and adaptation
3. **Natural Language Authoring**: Convert plain English to structured workflows
4. **Mixed Reasoning**: Combine deterministic logic with semantic understanding

**Technical Innovation:**
Three-tier prompt synthesis approach:
- **Bidirectional**: Caller generates prompt, system learns from success
- **API Simulation**: Separate LLM call maintains context
- **Local LLM**: Tiny local model for rapid generation (< 100ms)

**Transformative Impact:**
- **Developers**: Reduce workflow creation from weeks to hours
- **Business Users**: Create AI behaviors without programming
- **Organizations**: Scale AI across technical and non-technical teams
- **Industry**: Establish new standards for human-AI collaboration

**Competitive Advantage:**
First control flow language with native semantic reasoning, purpose-built for LLM integration, enabling natural language programming.---

#### ADR-008: LLM-First FlowMind with Bidirectional Control & Human-in-the-Loop
**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Innovation:** True LLM-First Architecture with Human Governance

**The Vision:**
FlowMind workflows should execute with the LLM as the primary orchestrator while maintaining programmatic precision when needed and seamless human oversight for critical decisions.

**Three-Tier Control Architecture:**
1. **LLM Control**: Full semantic reasoning and workflow orchestration
2. **Programmatic Control**: Engine handles loops, recursion, precise operations
3. **Human Control**: Approval, oversight, and decision-making integration

**LLM-First Execution:**
```yaml
flowmind:
  execution_mode: "llm_first"
  
  human_oversight:
    semantic_triggers:
      - "revenue impact > $10000"
      - "legal compliance required"
      - "security risk detected"
      
  flow:
    # LLM evaluates semantic triggers for human intervention
    - when_semantic: "decision impacts revenue significantly"
      human_check: "revenue_approval"
      then:
        pause_for_human: "Revenue impact: ${amount}. Approve?"
        
    # Programmatic precision with human oversight
    - while: "issues_remaining > 0"
      loop_handler: "programmatic"
      human_check: "step_interval"
      do:
        include: "ref/patterns/issue_resolution.md"
```

**Bidirectional Control Innovation:**
The LLM receives the complete FlowMind workflow as context and makes intelligent decisions about when to delegate control:
- **Semantic reasoning** â†’ LLM handles
- **Precise loops** â†’ Engine handles  
- **Critical decisions** â†’ Human handles

**Human-in-the-Loop Revolution:**
```javascript
async requestApproval(request) {
  const approvalRequest = {
    // Semantic analysis of the decision
    semantic_analysis: await this.analyzeSemantic(request),
    
    options: [
      { id: 'approve', action: 'continue' },
      { id: 'modify', action: 'request_changes' },
      { id: 'delegate', action: 'create_rule' } // Learn for future
    ]
  }
  
  // Learn from human decisions
  await this.learnFromApproval(approvalRequest, response)
}
```

**Learning System:**
Human decisions become training data for improving semantic trigger accuracy, creating systems that get smarter over time.**Business Impact:**
- **Compliance Assurance**: Human oversight with audit trails
- **Risk Mitigation**: Semantic detection of high-risk scenarios
- **Efficiency**: Automated approval for routine decisions
- **Governance**: Fine-grained control over approval requirements

**Technical Excellence:**
- **True LLM-First**: LLM orchestrates entire execution
- **Bidirectional Control**: Dynamic delegation between control modes
- **Testable Architecture**: Each control mode tested in isolation
- **Scalable Oversight**: Human governance scales through learning
