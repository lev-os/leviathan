# FlowMind Implementation Roadmap
## Isolated Tasks & Priority Analysis

**Based on ADR-000: FlowMind Interface Specification**

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: Sophisticated YAML design, broken interface layer, 49/93 tests failing
**Target State**: 1:1 YAML-to-FlowMind interface with semantic intelligence
**Strategy**: Fix foundation first, then build semantic features

---

## Task Isolation Analysis

### 🟢 **FULLY ISOLATED TASKS** (Can be done independently)

#### 1. **FlowMind Base Classes** (High Priority)
**Scope**: Core interface implementation
```javascript
// Can be built completely independently
class FlowMind { /* ... */ }
class AgentFlowMind extends FlowMind { /* ... */ }
class WorkflowFlowMind extends FlowMind { /* ... */ }
class FlowMindFactory { /* ... */ }
```
**Dependencies**: None
**Time**: 2-3 days
**Risk**: Low

#### 2. **YAML Type Detection Logic** (High Priority)
**Scope**: Auto-detect context types from YAML structure
```javascript
static _detectType(yaml, path) {
  // Path analysis, metadata parsing, config section detection
}
```
**Dependencies**: None
**Time**: 1 day
**Risk**: Low

#### 3. **Test Data Fixtures** (Medium Priority)
**Scope**: Create comprehensive test YAML files
```yaml
# tests/fixtures/agent-minimal.yaml
# tests/fixtures/workflow-complex.yaml
# tests/fixtures/malformed.yaml
```
**Dependencies**: None
**Time**: 1 day
**Risk**: Low

#### 4. **Performance Benchmarks** (Low Priority)
**Scope**: Establish loading time baselines
```javascript
// Benchmark suite for < 5ms loading target
```
**Dependencies**: None
**Time**: 0.5 day
**Risk**: Low

### 🟡 **PARTIALLY DEPENDENT TASKS** (Some dependencies)

#### 5. **ContextAssembler Integration** (High Priority)
**Scope**: Update assembler to return FlowMind instances
**Dependencies**: FlowMind base classes (Task #1)
**Time**: 1-2 days
**Risk**: Medium

#### 6. **Test Suite Updates** (High Priority)
**Scope**: Fix 49 failing tests to expect correct YAML properties
**Dependencies**: FlowMind classes, ContextAssembler integration
**Time**: 2-3 days
**Risk**: Medium

#### 7. **Validation Framework** (Medium Priority)
**Scope**: YAML structure validation against FlowMind expectations
**Dependencies**: FlowMind classes, Type detection
**Time**: 1-2 days
**Risk**: Low

### 🔴 **HIGHLY DEPENDENT TASKS** (Require multiple foundations)

#### 8. **Semantic Condition Framework** (Future)
**Scope**: Mock semantic evaluation for workflow triggers
**Dependencies**: FlowMind classes, Test suite working, Validation
**Time**: 3-5 days
**Risk**: High

#### 9. **LLM Integration** (Future)
**Scope**: Real semantic evaluation with Anthropic/OpenAI
**Dependencies**: Semantic framework, Working FlowMind system
**Time**: 5-7 days
**Risk**: High

## Recommended Implementation Order

### **Week 1: Foundation Sprint** 
**Goal**: Get all tests passing with solid FlowMind foundation

#### Day 1-2: Core FlowMind Implementation
```bash
# Task Priority: 1, 2 (Fully Isolated)
- Implement FlowMind base class with 1:1 YAML mapping
- Add AgentFlowMind, WorkflowFlowMind subclasses
- Create FlowMindFactory with type auto-detection
- Unit tests for FlowMind classes
```

#### Day 3-4: Integration & Test Fixes
```bash
# Task Priority: 5, 6 (Dependent on Days 1-2)
- Update ContextAssembler to return FlowMind instances
- Fix all 49 failing tests to expect correct properties
- Integration tests with real YAML files
```

#### Day 5: Polish & Validation
```bash
# Task Priority: 7, 3 (Final pieces)
- Add YAML validation framework
- Create comprehensive test fixtures
- Performance validation (< 5ms loading)
```

**Week 1 Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All 93 tests passing
- [ ] All YAML contexts load as appropriate FlowMind types
- [ ] Performance under 5ms per context
- [ ] Clean 1:1 YAML-to-interface mapping

### **Week 2: Intelligence Layer**
**Goal**: Add smart accessors and workflow integration hooks

#### Day 6-8: Intelligent Accessors
```bash
- Implement shouldTriggerWorkflow() logic
- Add activateEndpoint() with enhanced workflows  
- Workflow composition pattern detection
- Advanced property resolution
```

#### Day 9-10: Mock Semantic Framework
```bash
- Mock semantic condition evaluation
- Confidence threshold framework
- Trigger condition parsing
- Integration with existing workflow system
```

**Week 2 Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Workflow auto-triggering based on conditions
- [ ] Enhanced endpoint activation working
- [ ] Mock semantic evaluation operational
- [ ] Foundation ready for real LLM integration

### **Week 3+: Semantic Enhancement**
**Goal**: Real LLM integration and advanced features

#### Future Tasks (Week 3+):
```bash
- Real semantic evaluation with LLM APIs
- Natural language condition parsing
- Advanced workflow composition
- Production hardening and optimization
```

## Risk Assessment by Task

### **Low Risk** (Recommend doing first)
1. ✅ **FlowMind Base Classes** - Pure implementation, no dependencies
2. ✅ **YAML Type Detection** - Logic only, easily testable
3. ✅ **Test Fixtures** - Data creation, no integration complexity

### **Medium Risk** (Do after low risk)
4. ⚠️ **ContextAssembler Integration** - Touches existing system
5. ⚠️ **Test Suite Updates** - Many tests to update carefully
6. ⚠️ **Validation Framework** - Complex validation logic

### **High Risk** (Do last, after foundation solid)
7. 🚨 **Semantic Framework** - New architectural concepts
8. 🚨 **LLM Integration** - External dependencies, performance concerns

---

## Parallelization Opportunities

### **Can Work in Parallel**:
- **Developer A**: FlowMind base classes + Type detection (Tasks 1, 2)
- **Developer B**: Test fixtures + Performance benchmarks (Tasks 3, 4)
- **Integration**: After both complete, do ContextAssembler + Tests (Tasks 5, 6)

### **Must Be Sequential**:
- Foundation → Integration → Semantic features
- Base classes → Test updates → Validation
- Core interface → Smart accessors → LLM integration

---

## Immediate Next Actions (Priority Order)

### **🚀 Start Immediately** (Isolated, High Impact)
1. **Implement FlowMind base class** - Pure interface work, no dependencies
2. **Create type detection logic** - Can be built and tested independently
3. **Set up test fixtures** - Parallel task, helps with everything else

### **🔄 Start After Foundation** (Week 1 Day 3+)
4. **Update ContextAssembler** - Needs FlowMind classes first
5. **Fix failing tests** - Needs working FlowMind integration
6. **Add validation** - Polish task after core working

### **⏳ Future Priorities** (Week 2+)
7. **Mock semantic framework** - After solid foundation
8. **Real LLM integration** - Final enhancement layer

---

## Success Metrics by Week

### **Week 1 Metrics**
- Tests: 0 failing (currently 49 failing)
- Performance: < 5ms context loading maintained
- Coverage: All YAML contexts load as FlowMind instances
- Interface: 1:1 YAML property access working

### **Week 2 Metrics** 
- Intelligence: Workflow auto-triggering operational
- Integration: Enhanced endpoints working with workflows
- Framework: Mock semantic evaluation ready
- Architecture: Clean separation of data/intelligence layers

### **Week 3+ Metrics**
- Semantic: Real LLM evaluation with confidence thresholds
- Composition: Advanced workflow patterns working
- Production: Performance optimized, error handling robust
- Future: Foundation ready for FlowMind language features

---

**Recommendation: Start with Tasks 1 & 2 immediately. They're completely isolated, high-impact, and unblock everything else. The foundation approach ensures we build on solid ground rather than trying to fix a broken system.**
