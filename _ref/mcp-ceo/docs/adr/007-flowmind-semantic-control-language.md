# ADR-007: FlowMind Semantic-Aware Control Flow Language

## Status
Accepted

## Context
AI workflows are trapped between rigid programming and chaotic prompting. Current workflow orchestration tools lack semantic understanding, requiring complex rule chains instead of natural language conditions like "when user is frustrated." This creates a significant gap between human intent and machine precision in AI applications.

## Decision
Build FlowMind as a revolutionary YAML-based control flow language that bridges human intent and machine precision through semantic reasoning, enabling developers and business users to create AI workflows using natural language conditions alongside traditional logic.

## Architecture

### Core Innovation
FlowMind combines three breakthrough concepts:
1. **Semantic Control Flow**: Mix deterministic logic with natural language reasoning
2. **Dynamic Prompt Synthesis**: Runtime generation and adaptation of AI prompts  
3. **Natural Language Authoring**: Convert plain English descriptions to structured workflows

### Foundational Syntax
```yaml
# FlowMind: Traditional + Semantic Control Flow
flowmind:
  version: "1.0"
  name: "intelligent_customer_support"
  
  variables:
    user_context: "@input.context"
    emotion_level: "@semantic.analyze(user_context, 'emotional_intensity')"
    urgency: "@semantic.analyze(user_context, 'urgency')"
    
  flow:
    # Traditional logic
    - if: "context.tier == 'premium'"
      then:
        include: "ref/patterns/premium_support.md"
        
    # Semantic reasoning
    - when_semantic: "user is angry OR very frustrated" 
      confidence_threshold: 0.8
      then:
        include: "ref/patterns/de_escalation.md"
        tone: "empathetic"
        escalate: true
        
    # Mixed conditions
    - if: "context.issue_count > 3"
      and_semantic: "user seems ready to churn"
      then:
        workflow: "retention_specialist"
        priority: "urgent"
        
    # Adaptive loops
    - while: "issue_unresolved"
      and_when_semantic: "user engagement remains high"
      max_iterations: 5
      do:
        include: "ref/patterns/iterative_troubleshooting.md"
        collect: "solution_attempts"
```

### Technical Implementation
```javascript
class FlowMindEngine {
  constructor(config) {
    this.semanticEvaluator = new SemanticEvaluator({
      primary_llm: "anthropic-claude-3",
      fallback_llm: "openai-gpt-4", 
      local_llm: "phi-3-mini",
      cache: new RedisCache()
    })
    
    this.contextAssembler = new EnhancedContextAssembler()
    this.promptSynthesizer = new PromptSynthesizer()
  }
  
  async execute(flowDefinition, input) {
    const flow = await this.parseFlow(flowDefinition)
    const context = await this.createContext(input)
    
    return await this.executeFlow(flow, context)
  }
}
```

### Three-Tier Prompt Synthesis
1. **Bidirectional**: Caller generates prompt, system learns from success
2. **API Simulation**: Separate LLM call generates prompt, maintains context
3. **Local LLM**: Tiny local model for rapid prompt generation (< 100ms)

### Natural Language to FlowMind Conversion
```yaml
# User describes in plain English:
user_input: |
  "I want to analyze customer feedback, but when someone is really angry,
   handle that specially. Also, if technical issues are mentioned, 
   bring in a technical expert."

# AI Assistant converts to FlowMind:
generated_flow:
  flow:
    - include: "ref/patterns/feedback_analysis.md"
    
    - when_semantic: "customer is angry OR extremely upset"
      anger_threshold: 8  # out of 10 scale
      then:
        include: "ref/patterns/anger_management.md"
        escalate_to: "senior_support"
        
    - when_semantic: "technical issues OR bugs mentioned"
      complexity_filter: "medium_or_higher"
      then:
        include: "ref/experts/technical_expert.md"
```

### Integration with Existing Systems
```javascript
// Enhanced Context Assembler
class EnhancedContextAssembler extends DynamicContextAssembler {
  async assemble(recipe) {
    // Check if recipe includes FlowMind definition
    if (recipe.flowmind_definition) {
      return await this.assembleWithFlow(recipe)
    }
    
    // Fallback to original assembly
    return await super.assemble(recipe)
  }
  
  async assembleWithFlow(recipe) {
    const flowEngine = new FlowMindEngine(this.config)
    
    const context = {
      sources: recipe.sources,
      task: recipe.task,
      stageConfig: recipe.stageConfig,
      tokenLimit: recipe.tokenLimit
    }
    
    return await flowEngine.execute(recipe.flowmind_definition, context)
  }
}
```

## Benefits

### Competitive Advantages
1. **Semantic Awareness**: First control flow language with native semantic reasoning
2. **Developer Experience**: YAML-based syntax accessible to non-programmers
3. **AI-Native Architecture**: Purpose-built for LLM integration and prompt orchestration
4. **Natural Language Authoring**: Convert plain English to structured workflows
5. **Self-Learning Systems**: Improve through feedback and success pattern recognition

### Transformative Impact
- **For Developers**: Reduce complex AI workflow creation from weeks to hours
- **For Business Users**: Create sophisticated AI behaviors without programming
- **For Organizations**: Scale AI implementations across technical and non-technical teams
- **For the Industry**: Establish new standards for human-AI collaboration

## Consequences

### Positive
- Bridges gap between human intent and machine precision
- Enables natural language programming for AI workflows
- Creates self-improving systems through LLM feedback loops
- Establishes foundation for semantic computing platform

### Risks
- Dependency on LLM semantic evaluation performance
- Complexity of debugging semantic conditions
- Learning curve for new paradigm

### Mitigation
- Multi-tier evaluation with local model fallbacks

## Implementation Strategy

This ADR establishes FlowMind as the core innovation for semantic-aware AI workflow orchestration. Integration with existing MCP-CEO infrastructure through enhanced context assembler enables gradual adoption while building toward complete semantic computing platform.

FlowMind represents a fundamental shift from purely deterministic software to semantically aware systems that understand human intent and adapt in real-time, defining how humans and AI systems will collaborate in the decades to come.
