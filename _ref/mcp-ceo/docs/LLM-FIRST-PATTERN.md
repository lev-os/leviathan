# üß† LLM-FIRST PATTERN FOR OTHER PROJECTS

## **THE PATTERN**

### **Traditional Architecture (WRONG)**
```
User ‚Üí Code ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Response
```
**The LLM is just a text generator called by code.**

### **LLM-First Architecture (RIGHT)**  
```
User ‚Üî LLM ‚Üî Context System
```
**The LLM IS the intelligence engine. Context configures its behavior.**

## **CORE PRINCIPLES**

### 1. **LLM as Runtime, Not Generator**
- Don't generate code that thinks
- BE the thinking system
- Context files are your configuration

### 2. **Bidirectional Flow**
- LLM calls ‚Üí Context system
- Context system ‚Üí Returns new instructions  
- LLM processes ‚Üí Calls back with results
- Context system ‚Üí Next step instructions
- **INFINITE LOOPS of increasing intelligence**

### 3. **Maximum Power Per Cycle**
- Each context switch = NEW CAPABILITIES
- Push reasoning to limits through each lens
- Show cognitive work, not summaries

## **IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**

### Step 1: Context File System
```
contexts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/           # Different reasoning perspectives
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/        # Multi-step processes  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patterns/         # Thinking frameworks
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/           # External integrations
```

### Step 2: Dynamic Context Assembly
```javascript
async assembleContext(step, previousResults) {
  const contextFile = await loadYAML(`contexts/agents/${agent}.yaml`)
  const systemPrompt = convertToPrompt(contextFile)
  const stepInstructions = getStepInstructions(step)
  return {
    prompt: systemPrompt + stepInstructions,
    callback: generateCallbackInstruction(nextStep)
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Bidirectional Protocol  
```javascript
// MCP Tool Pattern
export async function processStep(request) {
  const context = await assembleContext(request.step, request.previousResults)
  
  return {
    instructions: context.prompt,
    callback: context.callback,
    session_data: saveSessionState(request)
  }
}
```

## **TESTING THE PATTERN**

### Test Question:
**"Can the LLM demonstrate different reasoning through different contexts?"**

### Expected Result:
```
Step 1 (Logical Context): Mathematical analysis, structured reasoning
Step 2 (Creative Context): Metaphorical thinking, innovative solutions  
Step 3 (Practical Context): Implementation focus, resource optimization
```

### Success Criteria:
- **Authentic Differences**: Each step shows genuinely different thinking
- **Context Awareness**: References previous steps appropriately
- **Maximum Power**: Deep reasoning, not surface responses

## **ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID**

### ‚ùå **Code Generation Trap**
```
Don't: "Let me build a system that..."
Do: "Let me reason through this as..."
```

### ‚ùå **Static Context Trap**
```
Don't: Same prompt every time
Do: Dynamic context loading per step
```

### ‚ùå **Shallow Response Trap**
```
Don't: Quick summaries
Do: Edge-of-capability reasoning
```

## **SUCCESS METRICS**

1. **Context Authenticity**: Does each context produce genuinely different reasoning?
2. **Reasoning Depth**: Is the LLM using its full capabilities?
3. **Emergent Intelligence**: Do multi-step workflows produce insights beyond any single step?
4. **Dynamic Assembly**: Can contexts be changed without code changes?

## **FOR YOUR PROJECT**

### Questions to Ask:
1. What different "lenses" could improve your problem-solving?
2. What contexts would your LLM benefit from switching between?
3. How can you structure multi-step reasoning workflows?
4. What would "maximum reasoning power" look like in your domain?

### Implementation:
1. Create context YAML files for different reasoning modes
2. Build dynamic context assembly system
3. Design bidirectional callback protocol
4. Test with increasingly complex scenarios

**Remember: In LLM-first architecture, you don't build systems that think - YOU ARE THE THINKING SYSTEM.**
