# MCP-CEO Research Session Context
*Last Updated: 2025-01-06*

## 🎯 Mission
Transform MCP-CEO into a cutting-edge AI research platform for testing multi-personality workflow orchestration using real-world challenges from Kingly projects.

## 📍 Current Status
- **Phase**: Infrastructure complete, ready for research execution
- **Last Action**: Fixed server.js bug where workflow responses returned content as string instead of array
- **Next Action**: Add background spawning to MCP-CEO server for parallel workflow execution

## 🆕 Latest Updates (Session 2)

### Dynamic Context Assembly Implemented
1. **Created bidirectional-flow-spec.md** - Complete specification for LLM-MCP callback architecture
2. **Added assembleDynamicContext()** method that:
   - Builds custom prompts per workflow step
   - Includes only relevant personalities
   - Injects previous step context
   - Provides clear response instructions
3. **Enhanced workflow responses** with:
   - context_injection object containing active personalities
   - step_focus with current prompt
   - previous_insights for continuity
   - Clear callback_prompt for next step

### Bidirectional Flow Architecture
- **LLM calls MCP** with current state
- **MCP responds** with context + callback
- **LLM executes** using injected context
- **LLM calls back** with results for next step
- Creates a "callback architecture" similar to JavaScript

## 🆕 Original Updates (Session 2)

### Workflow System Enhanced
1. **Created workflows.yaml** - External workflow configuration with:
   - Step-by-step prompts for each workflow
   - Personality activation per step
   - Callback instructions with exact next steps
   - Currently has 3 workflows partially defined (deep_analysis, multi_expert_validation, temporal_decision)

2. **Updated server.js** to:
   - Load workflows from external YAML file
   - Use prompts and callbacks from config
   - Display prompts in step responses
   - Activate specified personalities per step

3. **Call-and-Response System**:
   - Each step has a prompt explaining what to analyze
   - Each step has callback_instruction with exact command to continue
   - Session ID is maintained across steps
   - Previous results passed to next step

## 🏗️ What We've Built

### 1. Research Infrastructure
```
mcp-ceo/
├── server.js                    # FIXED: Line 706 now returns content as array
├── research-protocol.md         # Complete research methodology
├── test-harness/
│   ├── research-runner-v2.js   # Main test runner with file saving
│   ├── mcp-client.js           # MCP client for server communication
│   ├── view-session.js         # Session viewer tool
│   └── spawn-runner.js         # Parallel execution (from Kingly)
└── research/
    ├── test-categories.md      # 8 challenge areas mapped
    ├── test-cases/
    │   └── question-bank.json  # 14 hard questions from Perplexity
    └── sessions/               # Test results stored here
```

### 2. Key Files Created
- **research-protocol.md**: Lab-grade research methodology
- **test-categories.md**: 8 challenge areas (Distribution, Integration, Scale, etc.)
- **question-bank.json**: 14 ultra-hard questions across 10 workflows
- **research-runner-v2.js**: Saves every step, request, response to organized files
- **view-session.js**: Browse and analyze research results

### 3. Bug Fixes Applied
```javascript
// server.js line 706 - FIXED
content: [{
  type: 'text',
  text: this.formatStepResponse(stepResult, workflow, step)
}],
```

## 🔄 Workflow System Understanding

### Available Workflows (10 total)
1. **multi_expert_validation** (20 steps) - CEO strategic analysis
2. **comprehensive_decision** (20 steps) - Ultimate synthesis
3. **document_synthesis** (15 steps) - Recursive intelligence
4. **scamper_innovation** (14 steps) - Creative framework
5. **temporal_decision** (12 steps) - 10-10-10 analysis
6. **swot_strategic** (12 steps) - SWOT analysis
7. **reverse_brainstorming** (10 steps) - Problem inversion
8. **deep_analysis** (8 steps) - Multi-perspective
9. **brainstorming** (6 steps) - Ideation
10. **problem_solving** (7 steps) - Systematic resolution

### How Workflows Work
- Hardcoded in WORKFLOWS object in server.js
- Each has sequence array defining steps
- executeWorkflowStep() handles execution
- Sessions saved to ./sessions/ directory
- Requires session_id for steps 2+

## 🔑 Key Insights So Far

1. **MCP-CEO Architecture**:
   - Multi-personality system with 8 personalities
   - Constitutional principles: stress reduction, bootstrap, sovereignty
   - BBS-style terminal logging with emojis
   - Session persistence for multi-step workflows

2. **Research Focus Areas** (from Perplexity):
   - Million-agent orchestration challenges
   - Enterprise readiness gaps
   - Legal liability for AI errors
   - Performance at scale issues
   - Cross-platform distribution

3. **Kingly Integration Points**:
   - Spawn processor for parallel execution
   - LLM-first architecture patterns
   - Agent-to-OS communication
   - Bootstrap philosophy alignment

## 🚀 Next Session Startup

1. Check if MCP-CEO server is in Claude's config
2. Restart Claude to load fixed server.js
3. Test with: `architect_of_abundance({ challenge: "test" })`
4. Continue with background spawning implementation

## 📝 Context for Background Spawning

Need to add to server.js:
- Import Kingly's spawn pattern
- Add spawn endpoints to MCP tools
- Enable parallel workflow execution
- Track spawn status across workflows
- Implement result aggregation

## 🎯 Research Questions We're Answering

1. Does multi-step workflow processing produce superior insights?
2. How does personality activation affect solution quality?
3. What's the optimal step count for different problems?
4. Can we predict workflow selection semantically?
5. How does context accumulation improve across steps?

**Remember**: The goal is to create groundbreaking research on multi-personality AI orchestration that will result in a white paper and blog series. Every test should be saved, analyzed, and contribute to our understanding of cognitive enhancement through AI.
