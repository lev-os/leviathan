# MCP-CEO Dynamic Context Assembly Progress

## 🎯 Goal
Transform MCP-CEO into a dynamic workflow orchestration system with bi-directional communication between Claude and specialized multi-step workflows.

## ✅ Completed

### 1. Enhanced MCP Server Architecture
- Added workflow engine supporting 10+ complex workflows (up to 20 steps)
- Implemented session management with file-based persistence
- Created callback mechanism for multi-step processes
- Added dynamic context assembly capabilities

### 2. BBS/Hacker Terminal Logging
- Built TerminalLogger class with elapsed time tracking
- Added color-coded categories with emojis
- Implemented ASCII art banner and box-drawing UI
- Real-time progress bars for workflow steps
- Personality activation alerts with icons

### 3. Workflow Library
- **multi_expert_validation** (20 steps) - CEO-level strategic analysis
- **document_synthesis** (15 steps) - Recursive document intelligence
- **scamper_innovation** (14 steps) - Creative framework
- **temporal_decision** (12 steps) - 10-10-10 time analysis
- **comprehensive_decision** (20 steps) - Ultimate decision synthesis
- Plus 5 more workflows for testing

### 4. System Architecture
- Preserved backward compatibility with original API
- Added new workflow_request parameter structure
- Session files saved as `./sessions/{uuid}-{topic}.json`
- Workflows defined in WORKFLOWS constant

### 5. Callback-Based Workflow Implementation (2025-02-06)
- Removed all mock/hardcoded personality responses
- Implemented true callback pattern where MCP provides instructions
- LLM processes as personalities and calls back with responses
- Created ceo-core.js extracting business logic for reusability
- Built cli-clean.js for direct testing without MCP protocol overhead

### 6. Hot Reload Development Server
- Created server-hot.js that watches ceo-core.js for changes
- MCP connection stays alive while business logic hot reloads
- Configured mcp-ceo-proto to use hot reload server
- Enables rapid iteration without restarting Claude Desktop

## 🚀 Current Work (2025-02-06)

### Session Management Enhancement
- Sessions now save to organized folder structure:
  ```
  sessions/{session-id}/
  ├── session.json      # Overall session state
  ├── README.md         # Human-readable summary
  ├── step-1.json       # Raw step data
  └── step-1.md         # Step summary with context
  ```

### Callback Flow Implemented
1. User provides challenge to start workflow
2. MCP returns instructions for LLM to act as specific personalities
3. LLM processes and calls back with response
4. MCP saves response and provides next step instructions
5. Process repeats until workflow completes

### Key Architecture Decisions
1. **Callback Pattern**: MCP gives instructions → LLM processes → LLM calls back with response
2. **Session Persistence**: Each session gets its own folder with detailed step logs
3. **Hot Reload**: server-hot.js watches ceo-core.js for changes without restarting MCP connection
4. **Direct CLI**: Bypasses MCP protocol for rapid testing during development

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Test hot reload server after Claude Desktop restart
2. Complete full 3-step workflow with real LLM processing
3. Implement better markdown output formatting:
   - step-{n}-input.md: What the LLM called with
   - step-{n}-output.md: Instructions from MCP
   - step-{n}-debug.json: All metadata and context

### Enhancement Tasks
1. Add final.md synthesis after workflow completion
2. Handle context window limits for 20-step workflows
3. Chain to document synthesis workflow when context gets large
4. Implement workflow result aggregation

## 💡 Key Insights

The system now supports true bi-directional communication where:
- Claude (thin prompt) parses intent and selects workflow
- MCP executes workflow step and returns instructions
- Claude follows callback prompt to continue
- Session state persists between calls
- Each step builds on previous context

This creates a **cognitive loop** where the LLM and MCP server enhance each other's capabilities through structured multi-step reasoning.

## 🧪 Test Command Examples

```bash
# Test single response mode
Use architect_of_abundance with challenge: "How do I scale my startup?"

# Test workflow mode
Use architect_of_abundance with workflow_request: {type: "simple_test", step: 1}

# Continue workflow with response
Use architect_of_abundance with workflow_request: {
  type: "simple_test", 
  step: 2, 
  session_id: "uuid-here",
  previous_results: {
    response: "Your detailed response as the personalities..."
  }
}
```

## 🔮 Vision

This architecture enables:
- **Infinite prompt scaling** through dynamic loading
- **Complex reasoning** through multi-step workflows
- **Cognitive enhancement** via bi-directional communication
- **Learning systems** that improve over time
- **Modular intelligence** that can be composed

The MCP becomes a **cognitive prosthetic** that extends Claude's capabilities beyond single-turn interactions into complex, stateful reasoning processes.

## 🧪 Research Lab Initiative

### Research Protocol Established
Created comprehensive research protocol treating this as cutting-edge AI research:
- **Objective**: Validate multi-personality workflow orchestration
- **Method**: Test with real-world challenges and measure effectiveness
- **Test Infrastructure**: Automated runners with baseline comparison
- **Deliverables**: White paper + blog post series
