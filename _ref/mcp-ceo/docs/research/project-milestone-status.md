## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### **Priority 1: Core Protocol Implementation**
```javascript
// Target Implementation
class ProtocolRegistry {
  constructor() {
    this.coreProtocols = new Map()
    this.userProtocols = new Map() // Takes precedence
    this.cache = new Map()
  }
  
  async resolve(uri) {
    // Implementation needed
  }
}
```

### **Priority 2: Agent Protocol Auto-Discovery**
```javascript
// Target Implementation  
class AgentProtocol {
  async buildIndex() {
    // Scan contexts/agents/ for metadata
    // Build protocol → context mappings
  }
  
  async resolve(path, fragment) {
    // Auto-resolve agent://cortisol_guardian
  }
}
```
