## Executive Summary

**FlowMind** is a revolutionary YAML-based control flow language that bridges human intent and machine precision through semantic reasoning. It enables developers and business users to create AI workflows using natural language conditions like "when the user seems frustrated" alongside traditional logic, fundamentally transforming how we orchestrate LLM-powered applications.

### Core Innovation
FlowMind combines three breakthrough concepts:
1. **Semantic Control Flow**: Mix deterministic logic with natural language reasoning
2. **Dynamic Prompt Synthesis**: Runtime generation and adaptation of AI prompts
3. **Natural Language Authoring**: Convert plain English descriptions to structured workflows

## The FlowMind Language

### 1. Foundational Syntax
```yaml
# FlowMind: Traditional + Semantic Control Flow
flowmind:
  version: "1.0"
  name: "intelligent_customer_support"
  
  variables:
    user_context: "@input.context"
    emotion_level: "@semantic.analyze(user_context, 'emotional_intensity')"
    urgency: "@semantic.analyze(user_context, 'urgency')"
    
  flow:
    # Traditional logic
    - if: "context.tier == 'premium'"
      then:
        include: "ref/patterns/premium_support.md"
        
    # Semantic reasoning
    - when_semantic: "user is angry OR very frustrated" 
      confidence_threshold: 0.8
      then:
        include: "ref/patterns/de_escalation.md"
        tone: "empathetic"
        escalate: true
        
    # Mixed conditions
    - if: "context.issue_count > 3"
      and_semantic: "user seems ready to churn"
      then:
        workflow: "retention_specialist"
        priority: "urgent"
        
    # Adaptive loops
    - while: "issue_unresolved"
      and_when_semantic: "user engagement remains high"
      max_iterations: 5
      do:
        include: "ref/patterns/iterative_troubleshooting.md"
        collect: "solution_attempts"
```

### 2. Natural Language to FlowMind Conversion
```yaml
# User describes in plain English:
user_input: |
  "I want to analyze customer feedback, but when someone is really angry,
   handle that specially. Also, if technical issues are mentioned, 
   bring in a technical expert."

# AI Assistant converts to FlowMind:
generated_flow:
  flow:
    - include: "ref/patterns/feedback_analysis.md"
    
    - when_semantic: "customer is angry OR extremely upset"
      anger_threshold: 8  # out of 10 scale
      then:
        include: "ref/patterns/anger_management.md"
        escalate_to: "senior_support"
        
    - when_semantic: "technical issues OR bugs mentioned"
      complexity_filter: "medium_or_higher"
      then:
        include: "ref/experts/technical_expert.md"
        
    - if: "anger_detected AND technical_issues"
      then:
        workflow: "escalated_technical_support"
        notify: "management"
```

### 3. Prompt Synthesis Integration
```yaml
# Dynamic prompt generation within FlowMind
prompt_synthesis:
  mode: "bidirectional"  # caller generates, system validates
  
  generate_prompt_step:
    semantic_trigger: "situation requires specialized expertise"
    
    specification_generation:
      prompt: |
        Based on context: ${situation_analysis}
        Generate prompt specification for: ${required_expertise}
        
        Include:
        - Expertise level needed
        - Communication style
        - Success criteria
        - Constraints and boundaries
        
    caller_implementation:
      instruction: |
        Please write a specialized system prompt based on:
        ${generated_specification}
        
        Use chain-of-thought reasoning and include examples.
        
    validation_and_execution:
      validate_against: ["expertise_coverage", "tone_appropriateness", "goal_alignment"]
      execute_with: "${caller_generated_prompt}"
      
  feedback_loop:
    collect_metrics: ["goal_achievement", "user_satisfaction", "response_quality"]
    adapt_future_specifications: true
    improve_semantic_detection: true
```

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Core Engine Design
```javascript
class FlowMindEngine {
  constructor(config) {
    this.semanticEvaluator = new SemanticEvaluator({
      primary_llm: "anthropic-claude-3",
      fallback_llm: "openai-gpt-4", 
      local_llm: "phi-3-mini",
      cache: new RedisCache()
    })
    
    this.contextAssembler = new EnhancedContextAssembler()
    this.promptSynthesizer = new PromptSynthesizer()
  }
  
  async execute(flowDefinition, input) {
    const flow = await this.parseFlow(flowDefinition)
    const context = await this.createContext(input)
    
    return await this.executeFlow(flow, context)
  }
}

class SemanticEvaluator {
  async evaluate(condition, context) {
    // 1. Check cache first (microseconds)
    const cached = await this.cache.get(this.cacheKey(condition, context))
    if (cached) return cached
    
    // 2. Try fast local evaluation (milliseconds)
    if (this.isSimpleCondition(condition)) {
      return await this.localEvaluate(condition, context)
    }
    
    // 3. Use full LLM reasoning (seconds)
    const result = await this.llmEvaluate(condition, context)
    await this.cache.set(this.cacheKey(condition, context), result, 300)
    
    return result
  }
}
```

### 2. Three-Tier Prompt Synthesis
```yaml
prompt_synthesis_approaches:
  
  # Approach 1: Bidirectional (Self-Learning)
  bidirectional:
    description: "Caller generates prompt, system learns from success"
    implementation:
      - analyze_challenge: "Extract key requirements and context"
      - generate_specification: "Create detailed prompt requirements"
      - caller_implements: "User writes prompt based on spec"
      - execute_and_validate: "Run with caller's prompt"
      - collect_feedback: "Measure success and store patterns"
      - learn_patterns: "Improve future specifications"
    benefits:
      - "Maintains caller's context and understanding"
      - "Creates self-improving system over time"
      - "Builds library of successful prompt patterns"
      
  # Approach 2: API Simulation (Fast Context Preservation)
  api_simulation:
    description: "Separate LLM call generates prompt, maintains juicy context"
    implementation:
      - context_analysis: "Understand current situation deeply"
      - prompt_generation_call: "Dedicated LLM generates specialized prompt"
      - context_injection: "Combine generated prompt with rich context"
      - execution: "Run with synthesized prompt and context"
    benefits:
      - "Faster than bidirectional approach"
      - "Preserves rich contextual information"
      - "Allows for prompt optimization and A/B testing"
      
  # Approach 3: Local LLM (Speed + Privacy)
  local_llm:
    description: "Tiny local model for rapid prompt generation"
    implementation:
      - local_model: "phi-3-mini via Ollama"
      - prompt_generation: "Fast local synthesis < 100ms"
      - quality_fallback: "Use API if local quality insufficient"
      - performance_monitoring: "Track speed vs accuracy tradeoffs"
    benefits:
      - "Sub-second prompt generation"
      - "Complete privacy and data control"
      - "Reduced API costs for high-volume usage"
```

### 3. Integration with Existing Systems
```javascript
// Enhanced Context Assembler
class EnhancedContextAssembler extends DynamicContextAssembler {
  async assemble(recipe) {
    // Check if recipe includes FlowMind definition
    if (recipe.flowsense_definition) {
      return await this.assembleWithFlow(recipe)
    }
    
    // Fallback to original assembly
    return await super.assemble(recipe)
  }
  
  async assembleWithFlow(recipe) {
    const flowEngine = new FlowMindEngine(this.config)
    
    const context = {
      sources: recipe.sources,
      task: recipe.task,
      stageConfig: recipe.stageConfig,
      tokenLimit: recipe.tokenLimit
    }
    
    return await flowEngine.execute(recipe.flowsense_definition, context)
  }
}
```
