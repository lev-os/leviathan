## Core Architecture

### Fundamental Principles

1. **The LLM IS the Runtime**
   - Not a tool called by code, but the execution engine itself
   - FlowMind contexts configure LLM behavior
   - We orchestrate intelligence, not create it

2. **Everything is a Context**
   - Single FlowMind class - no inheritance
   - Agents, workflows, patterns, types all inherit from FlowMind
   - Behavior comes from YAML data, not code

3. **Bidirectional Flow Creates Intelligence**
   - Context switching generates emergent intelligence
   - Each context switch gives LLM new cognitive powers
   - Continuous feedback loop between LLM and system

### The Complete System Flow

```
User → Beta LLM (Claude/GPT-4) → MCP Server → Alpha LLM (Llama) → Context Resolution → Beta LLM
```

## Dual LLM System

### Beta LLM (Conversational Intelligence)
- **Role**: Primary interface with user
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Full conversation context
  - Complex reasoning
  - Content summarization
  - Variable extraction
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Process user input (any size)
  - Create structured MCP tool calls
  - Synthesize responses
  - Maintain conversation flow

### Alpha LLM (Semantic Parser/Interpreter)
- **Role**: FlowMind DSL interpreter inside MCP
- **Capabilities**:
  - YAML parsing and interpretation
  - Semantic condition evaluation
  - Vector search coordination
  - Context matching
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Parse FlowMind YAML workflows
  - Evaluate semantic conditions
  - Match contexts via embeddings
  - Return structured instructions

### The Critical Insight

Alpha LLM is NOT a router - it's a **semantic interpreter** that:
1. Parses FlowMind's YAML DSL
2. Evaluates natural language conditions
3. Manages control flow (loops, conditionals)
4. Translates instructions for Beta LLM

---

## Bidirectional Flow Control

### Request Handling Flow

```
1. User: "I need help with a production issue"
   ↓
2. Beta LLM: Analyzes, summarizes, extracts variables
   ↓
3. Beta LLM: field_request({
     query: "production system issue",
     extracted_variables: {
       urgency: "high",
       domain: "technical",
       confidence: 0.95
     }
   })
   ↓
4. MCP Server receives request
   ↓
5. Alpha LLM: 
   - Parses request
   - Generates embeddings
   - Searches context RAG
   - Evaluates activation conditions
   ↓
6. Alpha LLM returns:
   {
     matches: [{
       uri: "workflow://incident-response",
       confidence: 0.92,
       activation_instruction: "Execute if 75% confident of production impact",
       execution_preview: "Recursive workflow until resolved"
     }]
   }
   ↓
7. Beta LLM: Evaluates recommendations, makes decision
   ↓
8. Beta LLM: execute_workflow("incident-response")
   ↓
9. Workflow execution with context switching...
```

### Dynamic Semantic Processing

The system continuously teaches Beta LLM through responses:

```json
// When Beta calls incorrectly:
{
  "status": "guidance_needed",
  "issue": "Query too vague",
  "guidance": "Be more specific. Include domain and urgency.",
  "next_action": "Retry with extracted variables"
}
```

## Compile-Time Infrastructure

### Build Process

```
1. Scan all YAML contexts (agents, workflows, patterns)
   ↓
2. Extract variables and semantic conditions
   ↓
3. Generate embeddings for:
   - Context descriptions
   - Activation conditions
   - Variable types
   ↓
4. Create compiled indices:
   - Context RAG (vector database)
   - Variable registry
   - Instruction sets
   ↓
5. Output compiled artifacts for runtime
```

### Variable Extraction & Compilation

```yaml
# Source: workflow://incident-response.yaml
activation_conditions:
  semantic_if: "user reports production impact"
  confidence_threshold: 0.75
  
variables:
  - urgency: ["low", "medium", "high", "critical"]
  - impact_scope: ["individual", "team", "department", "company-wide"]
  - system_component: ["frontend", "backend", "database", "infrastructure"]
```

**Compiled Output:**
```json
{
  "uri": "workflow://incident-response",
  "activation_embedding": [0.2, 0.8, 0.3, ...],
  "variables": {
    "urgency": {
      "type": "enum",
      "values": ["low", "medium", "high", "critical"],
      "embedding": [0.1, 0.9, ...]
    }
  },
  "compiled_instruction": "ONLY execute if 75% confident user reports production impact"
}
```

### Shared RAG Architecture

Both Alpha and Beta LLMs access:
- **Context embeddings** - Pre-computed semantic vectors
- **Variable registry** - All possible variables across system
- **Instruction sets** - Compiled activation/execution rules

## Runtime Execution Model

### MCP Tool Design

```javascript
// Universal discovery tool
{
  name: 'field_request',
  description: 'Universal context discovery via semantic search',
  inputSchema: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      query: { 
        type: 'string', 
        maxLength: 500,
        description: '2-sentence summary only'
      },
      extracted_variables: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          domain: { enum: ['technical', 'creative', 'regulatory'] },
          urgency: { enum: ['low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical'] },
          // Compile-time defined variables...
        }
      },
      confidence_level: { type: 'number', min: 0, max: 1 }
    },
    required: ['query', 'confidence_level']
  }
}

// Direct workflow execution (skip middleware)
{
  name: 'execute_workflow',
  inputSchema: {
    properties: {
      workflow_uri: { type: 'string' },
      initial_context: { type: 'object' },
      confidence: { type: 'number' }
    }
  }
}
```

### Inside MCP Server

```javascript
async function handle_field_request(query, variables) {
  // 1. Alpha LLM processes
  const semantic_tokens = await alpha_llm.tokenize(query)
  const query_embedding = await alpha_llm.embed(semantic_tokens)
  
  // 2. RAG search
  const matches = await vector_db.search(query_embedding, {
    filter: variables,
    top_k: 5
  })
  
  // 3. Alpha evaluates activation conditions
  const evaluated_matches = await alpha_llm.evaluate_conditions(
    matches, 
    query, 
    variables
  )
  
  // 4. Translate to Beta instructions
  return alpha_llm.translate_to_instructions(evaluated_matches)
}
```

## Scale Testing & Edge Cases

### Writer's Workflow Overlaps

**Challenge**: Multiple character development workflows for different genres

**Solution**: Multi-match response with disambiguation
```json
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "uri": "workflow://character-dev-romance",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "genre_match": "primary"
    },
    {
      "uri": "workflow://character-dev-fantasy",
      "confidence": 0.82,
      "genre_match": "primary"
    }
  ],
  "recommendation": "multi_genre_sequence",
  "guidance": "Start with romance, layer fantasy elements"
}
```

### Government Scale (100,000+ workflows)

**Challenge**: Managing federal/state/municipal hierarchies

**Solution**: Hierarchical RAG with inheritance
```
federal/ → state/ → county/ → city/
         ↓
    Variable inheritance at each level
    Semantic clustering reduces search space
```

### Content Volume Handling

**Challenge**: User dumps 5,000 word chapter

**Solution**: Bidirectional guidance
```
Beta processes → Summarizes → field_request with summary
System responds → "Use document chunking workflow first"
Beta follows guidance → Chunks → Multiple focused requests
```

## Conclusion

We've discovered that FlowMind isn't just an AI orchestration tool - it's a **semantic programming runtime** that makes LLMs first-class citizens of control flow. Through dual LLM architecture, compile-time intelligence, and bidirectional flow control, we can create systems that understand and execute human intent at scale.

The combination of:
- Pre-compiled context embeddings
- Structured variable extraction  
- Semantic condition evaluation
- Bidirectional teaching loops

Creates a system that can handle everything from simple requests to government-scale complexity while maintaining sub-second performance and human-level understanding.

This is the foundation for the next era of human-computer interaction.
