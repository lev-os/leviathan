# Testing Dynamic Context Assembly

## What We've Built

### 1. **Dynamic Context Assembly**
- Each workflow step gets a custom-assembled prompt
- Only relevant personalities are included
- Previous step context is injected
- Clear instructions for the LLM

### 2. **Bidirectional Flow**
```
LLM: "Help with X" + workflow_request
 ↓
MCP: Context + Callback instruction
 ↓
LLM: Processes with context
 ↓
LLM: Calls back with results
 ↓
(repeat for each step)
```

### 3. **Context Injection**
Each response now includes:
```json
"context_injection": {
  "active_personalities": ["cortisol_guardian", "systems_illuminator"],
  "step_focus": "The prompt for this step",
  "previous_insights": ["From last step"],
  "constraints": ["Core principles"]
}
```

## To Test

1. **Restart MCP server** to load changes
2. **Run simple_test workflow**:
```
architect_of_abundance({
  challenge: "What is the meaning of life?",
  workflow_request: {
    type: "simple_test",
    step: 1
  }
})
```

3. **Observe the response** should include:
   - Step prompt from workflows.yaml
   - Active personalities for that step
   - Clear callback instruction
   - Context injection object

## What's Different

**Before**: Static prompts, all personalities always loaded
**After**: Dynamic assembly, only relevant context per step

This creates a true "callback architecture" where the MCP server programs the LLM's behavior through structured responses!
