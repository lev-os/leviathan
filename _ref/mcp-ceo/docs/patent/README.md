# SEMANTIC CONTROL FLOW PATENT DOCUMENTATION

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive patent documentation for the revolutionary Semantic-Aware Control Flow innovation - the world's first programming paradigm where Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluate natural language conditions at runtime.

**Innovation Summary:** Instead of writing `if (sentiment_score < 0.3)`, developers can write `if "user seems frustrated"` and have it evaluated semantically during program execution.
