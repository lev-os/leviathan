- File patents defensively
- Use Apache 2.0 license with patent grants
- Create patent pledge for community
- Focus on protecting against competitors

**Patent Pledge Example:**
"We pledge not to assert our semantic control flow patents against any open source implementation that complies with our community standards."

### 2. Continuation Strategy

**Future Patents:**
1. **Protocol System Innovations**
   - Auto-discovery mechanisms
   - Universal addressing
   - Context assembly

2. **Performance Optimizations**

## CONCLUSION

This roadmap provides a comprehensive path from provisional filing through patent issuance while maintaining open source compatibility. The key is moving quickly on the provisional filing to establish priority while taking the full year to refine claims and build evidence for the strongest possible non-provisional application.

Remember: The provisional filing establishes your priority date. File first, refine later.
