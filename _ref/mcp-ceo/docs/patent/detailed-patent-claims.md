# DETAILED PATENT CLAIMS

## Independent Claims

### Claim 1: Core Method for Semantic Control Flow

A computer-implemented method for executing semantic-aware control flow in a programming environment, the method comprising:

a) receiving, by a processor, source code containing at least one control flow statement expressed in natural language;

b) parsing, by the processor, the source code to identify the natural language control flow statement and extract a semantic condition therefrom;

c) assembling, by the processor, contextual information from an execution environment, wherein the contextual information includes at least one of: current variable states, execution history, user interaction data, or external system states;

d) constructing, by the processor, an evaluation prompt by combining the semantic condition with the assembled contextual information;

e) transmitting, by the processor, the evaluation prompt to a large language model trained on natural language understanding;

f) receiving, by the processor, an evaluation response from the large language model, the response including a boolean result and a confidence score;

g) determining, by the processor, whether the confidence score exceeds a predetermined threshold;

h) when the confidence score exceeds the threshold, directing program execution flow based on the boolean result; and

i) when the confidence score does not exceed the threshold, executing a fallback flow path or requesting human clarification.

### Claim 2: Protocol-Based Context Assembly System

A system for semantic-aware program execution comprising:

a) a protocol registry configured to store and manage a plurality of protocol handlers, each protocol handler associated with a unique protocol identifier;

b) a context assembler configured to:
   - receive one or more protocol-based resource identifiers in the format "{protocol}://{path}#{fragment}?{query}";
   - resolve each resource identifier to its corresponding protocol handler;
   - invoke each protocol handler to load associated context data;
   - merge loaded context data into a unified execution context;

c) a semantic evaluation engine configured to:
   - extract natural language conditions from program code;
   - utilize the unified execution context to construct evaluation prompts;
   - interface with one or more large language models to evaluate the natural language conditions;
   - maintain confidence scores for each evaluation;

d) a flow controller configured to direct program execution based on semantic evaluation results and confidence scores;

e) an auto-discovery mechanism configured to automatically detect and register new context sources without manual configuration; and

f) a caching subsystem configured to store semantic evaluation results indexed by condition-context pairs to optimize performance.

### Claim 3: Programming Language with Native Semantic Conditions

A computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to interpret and execute a programming language supporting semantic-aware control flow, the language comprising:

a) syntax for expressing control flow conditions in natural language within code structures;

b) syntax for specifying confidence thresholds for semantic evaluations;

c) syntax for defining fallback behaviors when confidence thresholds are not met;

d) syntax for referencing contexts using protocol-based universal resource identifiers;

e) a runtime interpreter that:
   - identifies natural language conditions during code execution;
   - assembles relevant context for each condition evaluation;
   - interfaces with large language models for semantic evaluation;
   - implements control flow decisions based on evaluation results;

f) wherein the natural language conditions are evaluated dynamically at runtime rather than being preprocessed into boolean logic.
