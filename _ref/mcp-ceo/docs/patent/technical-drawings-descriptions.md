# TECHNICAL DRAWINGS AND FIGURES

## Figure 1: System Architecture Overview

### Description
A comprehensive system architecture diagram showing the four-layer design of the semantic-aware control flow system.

### Components
```
Application Layer (Top):
- FlowMind Parser: Processes YAML-based semantic control flow syntax
- Workflow Engine: Orchestrates execution of semantic workflows  
- Developer API: Provides programmatic access to semantic evaluation

Semantic Engine Layer:
- Condition Evaluator: Extracts and prepares natural language conditions
- Context Manager: Assembles relevant execution context
- Confidence Scorer: Analyzes LLM responses for reliability

LLM Interface Layer:
- Prompt Builder: Constructs optimized prompts for LLM evaluation
- Response Parser: Interprets LLM outputs into actionable decisions
- Caching Layer: Stores evaluation results for performance

Protocol Layer (Bottom):
- Protocol Registry: Manages protocol handlers
- Resource Resolver: Resolves protocol-based URIs
- Auto Discovery: Automatically detects and registers contexts
```

### Key Relationships
- Bidirectional flow between layers
- Context flows upward from Protocol to Semantic layers
- Decisions flow downward from LLM to Application layers
- Caching operates across all layers for optimization

## Figure 2: Semantic Evaluation Flow Chart

### Description
Detailed flowchart showing the step-by-step process of evaluating a natural language condition.

### Process Flow
```
START
  ↓
[Parse Source Code]
  ↓
[Identify Semantic Condition]
  ↓
[Check Cache] → (HIT) → [Return Cached Result]
  ↓ (MISS)
[Assemble Context]
  ↓
[Build Evaluation Prompt]
  ↓
[Submit to LLM]
  ↓
[Receive Response]
  ↓
[Parse Response]
  ↓
[Extract Boolean + Confidence]
  ↓
[Confidence > Threshold?]
  ├→ (YES) → [Execute Primary Branch]
  └→ (NO) → [Execute Fallback Branch]
  ↓
[Cache Result]
  ↓
END
```

### Decision Points
- Cache hit/miss determines evaluation path
- Confidence threshold gates execution branching
- Fallback mechanisms ensure reliable execution

## Figure 3: Protocol-Based Context Assembly

### Description
Illustrates how different protocol handlers work together to assemble execution context.

### Protocol Examples
```
User Request: Load contexts for customer service workflow

Protocol URIs:
- agent://customer-service-specialist
- file://contexts/company-policies.yaml
- markdown://templates/greeting.md
- script://generators/personalization.js
- http://api.company.com/customer/{{id}}

Assembly Process:
1. Protocol Registry receives URIs
2. Each URI mapped to appropriate handler
3. Handlers load content in parallel
4. Content merged by precedence rules
5. Unified context returned to semantic engine
```

### Handler Types
- Agent Handler: Loads personality contexts
- File Handler: Reads YAML/JSON configs
- Markdown Handler: Processes documentation
- Script Handler: Executes dynamic generators
- HTTP Handler: Fetches external data

## Figure 4: Performance Optimization Architecture

### Description
Shows the multi-level optimization strategy for production deployments.

### Optimization Layers
```
Level 1: Request Deduplication
- Identifies duplicate conditions in same execution
- Returns same result without re-evaluation

Level 2: Smart Caching
- LRU cache with semantic hashing
- Context-sensitive invalidation
- Compression for memory efficiency

Level 3: Batch Processing
- Groups multiple conditions
- Single LLM call for efficiency
- Parallel result distribution

Level 4: Predictive Preloading
- Analyzes code paths
- Preloads likely conditions
- Reduces perceived latency

Level 5: Edge Deployment
- Local LLM for common conditions
- Cloud fallback for complex cases
- Hybrid execution model
```

### Performance Metrics
- Cache hit rate: 70-90% in production
- Evaluation latency: <100ms average
- Batch efficiency: 5-10x improvement
- Memory usage: O(log n) growth

## Figure 5: Customer Service Workflow Example

### Description
Real-world example showing semantic control flow in a customer service scenario.

### Workflow Visualization
```
Start: Customer Message Received
  ↓
"Is customer asking about previous issue?"
  ├→ (Yes, 0.92 confidence)
  │   ↓
  │   Load Previous Context
  │   ↓
  │   "Does issue seem resolved?"
  │     ├→ (Yes, 0.78 confidence)
  │     │   → Close Ticket
  │     └→ (No, 0.78 confidence)
  │         → Continue Support
  └→ (No, 0.92 confidence)
      ↓
      New Issue Flow
      ↓
      "Is customer frustrated?"
        ├→ (Yes, 0.85 confidence)
        │   → Escalate to Human
        └→ (No, 0.85 confidence)
            → Automated Response
```

### Semantic Conditions Shown
- "Is customer asking about previous issue?"
- "Does issue seem resolved?"
- "Is customer frustrated?"

Each evaluated in context with confidence scoring

## Figure 6: LLM Integration Architecture

### Description
Detailed view of how LLMs integrate with the control flow system.

### Components
```
Prompt Template Engine:
- Condition: {natural_language_condition}
- Context: {assembled_context}
- Instructions: Evaluate if condition is true/false
- Output format: JSON with boolean and confidence

LLM Manager:
- Model selection based on complexity
- Load balancing across providers
- Fallback chain for reliability
- Cost optimization logic

Response Processor:
- JSON parsing and validation
- Confidence normalization
- Error handling

## Figure 8: Semantic Condition Examples

### Description
Visual comparison of traditional vs semantic control flow.

### Traditional Approach
```python
# Analyze sentiment
sentiment_score = analyze_sentiment(user_input)
frustration_keywords = check_keywords(user_input)
response_time = calculate_response_time()

# Complex boolean logic
if (sentiment_score < 0.3 and 
    frustration_keywords > 2 and 
    response_time > 5000):
    escalate_to_human()
```

### Semantic Approach
```yaml
if: "user seems frustrated with the response time"
confidence: 0.8
then: escalate_to_human
```

### Benefits Illustrated
- 80% reduction in code complexity
- Self-documenting conditions
- Adaptable without code changes
- Context-aware evaluation

### Discovery Flow
```
System Startup
  ↓
Scan Context Directories
  ↓
For Each Context File:
  ↓
  Parse Metadata Header
  ↓
  Extract Protocol Declaration
  ↓
  Register in Protocol Registry
  ↓
Context Available for Use

Example Context File:
---
protocol: agent://empathy-specialist
name: Empathy Specialist
description: Handles emotional support
capabilities:
  - emotional_understanding
  - supportive_responses
---

Content of context...
```

### Auto-Registration Benefits

- Contexts are self-describing
- Dynamic system extension
- No central registry needed
