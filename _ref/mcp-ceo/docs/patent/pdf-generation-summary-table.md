## 🔍 Your Observation Confirmed

You're absolutely right:
- **md-to-pdf** creates the nicest formatting but completely ignores fancy CSS like backgrounds and gradients
- It seems to use CSS for structure/layout but not for visual effects
- This makes it perfect for professional documents where clean formatting matters more than visual design

## 💡 Practical Recommendations

### For Patent Documents (Clean & Professional):
```bash
md-to-pdf patent.md  # Simple, clean, professional
```

### For Visually Rich Documents (With Colors):
```bash
pandoc input.md -s -o temp.html
weasyprint temp.html output.pdf
```

### For Quick Testing:
```bash
# See how different tools handle the same content
md-to-pdf test.md && mv test.pdf test-mdtopdf.pdf
pandoc test.md -o test.html && weasyprint test.html test-weasy.pdf
# Compare side by side
```

## 🎨 The Reality Check

- **Want professional formatting?** → md-to-pdf
- **Need background colors/gradients?** → WeasyPrint  
- **Want the best typography?** → Pandoc + LaTeX
- **Need it all?** → Doesn't exist yet!

No single tool does everything perfectly - each has its sweet spot.
