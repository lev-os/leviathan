# Semantic Control Flow Patent Test Document

## Testing Complex CSS Rendering with Dark Purple Theme

This document tests how different PDF generators handle complex CSS styling, including gradients, custom fonts, and advanced visual effects.

### Key Innovation Summary

The **Semantic Control Flow** system represents a <mark>paradigm shift</mark> in programming languages by enabling natural language conditions to be evaluated at runtime using Large Language Models.

> "Instead of writing `if (sentiment_score < 0.3)`, developers can now write `if user seems frustrated` and have it evaluated semantically during execution."

---

## Technical Architecture

### System Components

The system consists of four primary layers:

1. **Application Layer** - FlowMind Parser and Workflow Engine
2. **Semantic Engine Layer** - Condition Evaluator and Context Manager
3. **LLM Interface Layer** - Prompt Builder and Response Parser
4. **Protocol Layer** - Registry and Auto-Discovery

### Code Example

```yaml
# Traditional Approach
- analyze_sentiment: user_input
- if: sentiment_score < 0.3
  then:
    - escalate_to_human

# Semantic Approach
- if: "user seems frustrated with the response"
  confidence: 0.8
  then:
    - escalate_to_human
```

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Traditional | Semantic | Improvement |
|--------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Code Lines | 150 | 30 | 80% reduction |
| Maintainability | Low | High | 5x better |
| Context Awareness | None | Full | ∞ |
| Adaptability | Static | Dynamic | Revolutionary |

### Optimization Strategies

- **Caching**: LRU cache with semantic hashing
- **Batching**: Multiple conditions per LLM call
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation mechanisms

## Complex Nested Structure Test

<div class="container">
<h3>Multi-Level Testing</h3>

This section tests nested containers with various styling elements:

- First level item with **bold** and *italic* text
  - Second level with `inline code`
    - Third level with [linked text](https://example.com)
      - Fourth level for deep nesting test

<blockquote>
Nested blockquote to test border gradients and background transparency within containers.

## Mathematical Notation Test

The semantic evaluation confidence score is calculated as:

$$\text{confidence} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot s_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}$$

Where:
- $w_i$ = weight of evaluation criterion $i$
- $s_i$ = score for criterion $i$
- $n$ = number of criteria

### Long Code Block Test

```javascript
// Complex semantic evaluation function
async function evaluateSemanticCondition(condition, context) {
    const cacheKey = hashCondition(condition, context);
    
    // Check cache with gradient-based priority
    if (cache.has(cacheKey)) {
        const cached = cache.get(cacheKey);
        if (cached.confidence > 0.9) {
            return cached;
        }
    }
    
    // Build evaluation prompt with context
    const prompt = buildEvaluationPrompt(condition, context);
    
    // Query LLM with retry logic
    let response;
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        try {
            response = await llm.evaluate(prompt);
            break;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Attempt ${i + 1} failed:`, error);
            await sleep(1000 * Math.pow(2, i));
        }
    }
    
    // Parse and validate response
    const result = parseEvaluation(response);
    
    // Cache with TTL based on confidence
    const ttl = result.confidence > 0.8 ? 3600 : 300;
    cache.set(cacheKey, result, ttl);
    
    return result;
}
```
