# ðŸ§  META-PROMPTING METHODOLOGY

*LLM-first approach to breakthrough thinking and pattern discovery*

## ðŸ“‹ **PATTERN EXTRACTION**

**Source**: Designing agentic DX commands through comprehensive analysis
**Breakthrough**: Meta-prompting with full brainstorming arsenal produces 10x better insights than single-method analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ **THE METHODOLOGY**

### **Step 1: Multi-Method Analysis**
Apply ALL brainstorming techniques systematically:
- **Extreme Examples**: Test idea in radically different contexts
- **Figure Storming**: Channel expert perspectives  
- **SCAMPER**: Systematic transformation framework
- **SWOT**: Strategic analysis of strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats
- **SOAR**: Positive-focused strategic planning

### **Step 2: Cross-Pollination Synthesis**
Let insights from different methods inform each other:
- Mars mission needs + Coffee shop simplicity = Intuitive power tools
- Linus Torvalds mindset + AI researcher vision = Git-like operations with semantic understanding
- SCAMPER combinations + SWOT opportunities = Novel feature discoveries

### **Step 3: Pattern Recognition**
Identify meta-patterns across the analysis:
- What themes emerge across all methods?
- What contradictions reveal hidden tensions?
- What novel combinations weren't obvious before?

## ðŸš€ **SPECIFIC TRIGGERS FOR META-PROMPTING**

### **When To Use This**
- Designing new systems or capabilities
- Breaking through creative blocks  
- Need breakthrough thinking on complex problems
- Want to ensure comprehensive coverage of possibilities
- Stakeholder alignment on complex decisions

### **Implementation Template**
```
ðŸ§  Meta-Prompting for [PROBLEM]:

ðŸ”® Extreme Examples:
- Mars mission context: [insight]
- Coffee shop context: [insight]  
- Super Bowl context: [insight]

ðŸŽ­ Figure Storming:
- [Expert 1]: [perspective]
- [Expert 2]: [perspective]
- [Expert 3]: [perspective]

âš¡ SCAMPER Analysis:
- Substitute: [opportunity]
- Combine: [synthesis]
- Adapt: [modification]
- Modify: [enhancement]
- Eliminate: [simplification]

ðŸ“Š SWOT:
- Strengths: [advantages]
- Weaknesses: [limitations]
- Opportunities: [possibilities]
- Threats: [risks]

ðŸŽ¯ Synthesis: [cross-method insights]
```

## ðŸ’¡ **PROVEN RESULTS**

### **Agentic DX Commands Discovery**
- Started with "copy desktop commander commands"
- Meta-prompting revealed need for batch operations, semantic search, context awareness
- Produced comprehensive 212-line specification
- Generated 15+ novel command categories

### **Key Breakthroughs**
1. **Batch operations are CRITICAL** (from Mars mission + DevOps perspectives)
2. **Semantic > Text matching** (from AI researcher + pattern analysis)  
3. **Context-aware operations** (from system thinking + user experience)
4. **Learning capabilities** (from multiple expert perspectives)

## ðŸ”„ **REUSABLE PATTERN**

This methodology is itself meta - it can be applied to improve the methodology:
- **Extreme Examples**: How would [methodology experts] improve this?
- **Figure Storming**: What would [creative thinking pioneers] add?
- **SCAMPER**: How can we combine/adapt/modify this approach?
