# 🤖 SYNTHETIC AGENT FACTORY SPECIFICATION

*Future capability for dynamic agent creation and promotion*

## 📋 **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Automatically create agents when no appropriate agent exists for user requests
**Value**: Infinite extensibility without manual agent development
**Priority**: Future/Post-MVP - Advanced system capability

## 🎯 **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-SYNTHETIC-001: No Agent Found Trigger**
```yaml
Given: User makes a request requiring specific capabilities
When: No existing agent matches the required capabilities
Then: System triggers synthetic agent creation process
And: User is notified that a custom agent is being created
And: Request is queued while agent is generated
```

### **AC-SYNTHETIC-002: Template-Based Generation**
```yaml
Given: Synthetic agent creation is triggered
When: System analyzes the request type
Then: Appropriate template is selected (analysis/creative/problem-solver)
And: Agent specification is generated based on template
And: Agent capabilities are defined to match user need
And: System prompt is customized for the specific domain
```

### **AC-SYNTHETIC-003: Performance Tracking**
```yaml
Given: A synthetic agent is created and active
When: Agent handles user requests
Then: Usage count is tracked for each interaction
And: Success rate is calculated based on user satisfaction
And: Performance metrics are stored for promotion evaluation
And: Agent effectiveness is continuously monitored
```

### **AC-SYNTHETIC-004: Promotion Criteria**
```yaml
Given: A synthetic agent has performance history
When: Agent meets promotion criteria (min_usage: 5, min_success_rate: 0.8)
Then: Agent is promoted to permanent status
And: Agent is added to standard agent registry
And: Agent becomes available for future similar requests
And: Synthetic agent graduates to full agent capability
```## 🏭 **AGENT FACTORY PROCESS**

### **Agent Generation Templates**
```yaml
templates:
  analysis:
    base_capabilities: [analyze, research, evaluate, compare]
    persona: "analytical"
    system_prompt_template: |
      You are an analytical agent focused on {domain}.
      Your core strength is breaking down complex information and providing insights.
      
  creative:
    base_capabilities: [create, design, brainstorm, innovate]
    persona: "innovative"  
    system_prompt_template: |
      You are a creative agent specializing in {domain}.
      Your core strength is generating novel ideas and creative solutions.
      
  problem-solver:
    base_capabilities: [debug, optimize, troubleshoot, fix]
    persona: "systematic"
    system_prompt_template: |
      You are a problem-solving agent for {domain}.
      Your core strength is identifying issues and implementing solutions.
```

### **Generation Process**
```yaml
process:
  1_analyze_request:
    parse: user_intent, required_capabilities, domain_context
    identify: gap_in_existing_agents, specific_needs
    
  2_select_template:
    match: request_type to template_capabilities
    customize: template for specific domain and requirements
    
  3_generate_agent_spec:
    create: agent YAML with metadata, capabilities, system_prompt
    define: endpoints, tags, and routing patterns
    
  4_create_synthetic_agent:
    instantiate: agent with generated specification
    register: agent in synthetic agent registry
    test: basic functionality with sample requests
    
  5_track_performance:
    monitor: usage_count, success_rate, user_feedback
    log: all interactions for promotion evaluation
    
  6_promote_if_successful:
    evaluate: promotion_criteria (usage >= 5, success >= 0.8)
    promote: agent to permanent status if criteria met
    archive: unsuccessful agents after evaluation period
```

## 🧪 **TESTING APPROACH**

**Unit Tests**: Template selection, agent spec generation, promotion logic
**Integration Tests**: Complete synthetic agent lifecycle, performance tracking
**E2E Tests**: No agent found → synthetic creation → promotion to permanent

## 💡 **IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS**

### **Future Integration Points**
- **Agent routing**: Synthetic agents integrate with existing tag soup routing
- **MCP nexus**: Synthetic agents follow same agentInstructions patterns
- **Memory system**: Synthetic agents access same context and memory systems
- **Workflow integration**: Synthetic agents can participate in workflows

### **Promotion Strategy**
- **Trial period**: 30 days or 10 interactions (whichever comes first)
- **Success metrics**: User satisfaction, task completion rate, error frequency
- **Graduation process**: Synthetic agent becomes permanent with full capabilities
- **Archive policy**: Unsuccessful agents archived but learnings retained
