# 🧬 SELF-EVOLUTION SYSTEM (Future Vision)

*Captured from i-behave.md - for post-V1 implementation*

## 🎯 **CONCEPT**

System reads its own code and writes YAML to match, creating continuous self-improvement loop.

## 🔬 **MECHANISM**

```yaml
prompt_evolution:
  1. LLM reads seed code structure
  2. LLM understands current capabilities  
  3. LLM writes YAML definitions to match code
  4. LLM extends system prompts based on discovered patterns
  5. System self-improves through iteration
```

## 💡 **EXAMPLE**

```
LLM analyzes seed/orchestrator.js:
"I see keyword routing for 'plan' → ceo and 'implement' → dev"

LLM writes YAML:
routing_patterns:
  business_keywords: [plan, strategy, decide, approve]
  technical_keywords: [implement, code, build, fix]
```

## ⏰ **IMPLEMENTATION TIMING**

**Prerequisites**: 
- Synthetic agent factory working
- Experimental workflow system
- Stable core system for safe evolution

**Priority**: Post-V1, when we have foundation to evolve safely
