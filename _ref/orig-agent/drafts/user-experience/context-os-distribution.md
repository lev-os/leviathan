# üåç Context OS Distribution System

*The operating system is just a collection of contexts - infinitely composable, shareable, and evolvable*

## Vision

Kingly OS isn't installed - it's composed. Users don't configure software - they collect contexts. The `/contexts/` folder IS the operating system, defining everything from UI themes to agent behaviors to workflow patterns.

## Core Philosophy

```yaml
principles:
  - "OS as context collection"
  - "Behavior as shareable packages"
  - "Community-driven evolution"
  - "Infinite composability"
  - "Zero core complexity"
```

## Architecture

### Minimal OS Core

```yaml
# The ENTIRE Kingly OS core
kingly_os_core:
  size: "< 1MB"
  
  responsibilities:
    - context_loading: "Load contexts from filesystem"
    - type_recognition: "Identify context types"
    - cascade_resolution: "Handle inheritance"
    - dynamic_assembly: "Runtime composition"
    - plugin_execution: "Run context behaviors"
    
  # Everything else is contexts!
```

### Context Types Registry

```yaml
# Core recognizes these types
registered_types:
  agent:
    purpose: "Intelligent actors"
    requires: ["capabilities", "interaction_templates"]
    invokable: true
    
  workflow:
    purpose: "Multi-step processes"
    requires: ["steps", "triggers"]
    executable: true
    
  theme:
    purpose: "UI/UX styling"
    requires: ["colors", "components"]
    applicable: true
    
  pattern:
    purpose: "Reusable templates"
    requires: ["template", "variables"]
    instantiable: true
    
  preference:
    purpose: "User settings"
    requires: ["rules", "precedence"]
    observable: true
    
  tool:
    purpose: "Callable functions"
    requires: ["function", "parameters"]
    callable: true
    
  knowledge:
    purpose: "Domain information"
    requires: ["content", "metadata"]
    queryable: true
    
  # Extensible - new types via contexts
  custom_type:
    defined_by: "context"
    validated_by: "schema"
```

### Context Package Structure

```yaml
# Each context is a mini-package
context-package/
  context.yaml          # Metadata and configuration
  README.md            # Documentation
  LICENSE              # Usage rights
  assets/              # Supporting files
  tests/               # Validation tests
  
  # Optional
  install.js           # Setup script
  dependencies.yaml    # Required contexts
  examples/            # Usage examples
```

### Context Discovery & Sharing

```yaml
# Local contexts
~/.kingly/contexts/
  installed/          # Active contexts
  available/          # Downloaded but inactive
  cache/              # Temporary storage

# Registry structure
registry.kingly.ai/
  official/           # Kingly-certified
  community/          # User-submitted
  enterprise/         # Private registries
  
# Sharing commands
kingly share theme my-awesome-theme
kingly publish pattern agile-on-steroids
kingly export workspace my-startup-template
```

### Context Composition

```yaml
# Contexts can be composed
startup-workspace/
  extends:
    - "@kingly/base-workspace"
    - "@community/lean-startup"
    
  overrides:
    theme: "startup-brand"
    preferences: 
      output: "concise"
      
  adds:
    patterns:
      - "custom-mvp-flow"
      - "growth-experiments"
```

### Cascading Context Resolution

```yaml
# Contexts cascade from global to specific
resolution_order:
  1. project/contexts/        # Most specific
  2. workspace/contexts/      # Workspace level
  3. ~/.kingly/contexts/      # User level
  4. /etc/kingly/contexts/    # System level
  5. @registry/contexts/      # Remote fallback

# Child contexts override parents
example:
  global_theme: "dark"
  workspace_theme: "corporate"  # Wins in workspace
  project_theme: "minimal"      # Wins in project
```

## Implementation Features

### Version Control

```yaml
# Every context is versioned
context.yaml:
  version: "1.2.3"
  compatibility: "^1.0.0"
  
# Version operations
kingly update contexts          # Update all
kingly pin theme@1.2.3         # Lock version
kingly rollback pattern:agile  # Previous version
```

### Dependency Management

```yaml
# contexts/my-workflow/context.yaml
dependencies:
  required:
    - "@kingly/base-workflow": "^2.0.0"
    - "agent://orchestrator": "latest"
    
  optional:
    - "theme://dark-mode": "prefer"
    
  conflicts:
    - "workflow://old-style": "*"
```

### Security & Validation

```yaml
security:
  sandboxing:
    - "Contexts run in isolation"
    - "Resource limits enforced"
    - "Permission system for capabilities"
    
  validation:
    - "Schema verification"
    - "Community reviews"
    - "Automated testing"
    - "AI safety scanning"
    
  trust_levels:
    official: "Kingly certified"
    verified: "Community tested"
    experimental: "Use with caution"
    untrusted: "No verification"
```

### Performance Optimization

```yaml
optimization:
  lazy_loading:
    - "Contexts loaded on demand"
    - "Intelligent prefetching"
    - "Memory management"
    
  caching:
    - "Compiled contexts cached"
    - "Assembly results stored"
    - "Network requests minimized"
    
  hot_reload:
    - "Context changes detected"
    - "Live updates without restart"
    - "Development mode features"
```

## Usage Examples

### Starting Fresh

```bash
# Initialize with flavor
kingly init --flavor startup

# Add contexts as needed
kingly add pattern lean-canvas
kingly add theme minimal-focus
kingly add agent product-manager

# Your OS is ready!
```

### Sharing Your Setup

```bash
# Export your entire OS configuration
kingly export os my-perfect-setup

# Others can recreate your exact environment
kingly import os https://contexts.io/user/perfect-setup

# Or cherry-pick pieces
kingly add contexts from user/perfect-setup --only themes
```

### Building Custom Distributions

```yaml
# my-company-os.yaml
name: "AcmeCorp Standard OS"
base: "@kingly/enterprise"

contexts:
  agents:
    - "@acme/company-ceo"
    - "@acme/security-officer"
    
  workflows:
    - "@acme/deployment-pipeline"
    - "@acme/incident-response"
    
  themes:
    - "@acme/brand-theme"
    
  compliance:
    - "@enterprise/sox"
    - "@enterprise/gdpr"

# Deploy to team
kingly build distribution my-company-os.yaml
kingly deploy @acme/standard-os --to team
```

### Context Marketplace

```bash
# Browse contexts
kingly search "react testing"
> Found 24 contexts:
> - pattern://tdd-react (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 2.5k)
> - workflow://react-test-suite (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ 1.8k)
> - agent://react-tester (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ 900)

# Install with ratings
kingly add pattern://tdd-react --min-rating 4

# Create and monetize
kingly publish premium pattern://enterprise-auth --price $99
```

## Evolution Patterns

### Community-Driven Development

```yaml
evolution_cycle:
  1_experiment:
    - "User creates custom context"
    - "Solves specific problem"
    
  2_share:
    - "Published to community"
    - "Others try and rate"
    
  3_evolve:
    - "Forks and improvements"
    - "Best versions bubble up"
    
  4_standardize:
    - "Popular contexts become official"
    - "Included in distributions"
```

### AI-Optimized Selection

```yaml
# AI helps choose contexts
kingly recommend "I'm building a SaaS startup"

> Recommended contexts:
> - distribution://startup-edition
> - pattern://saas-architecture
> - workflow://customer-development
> - agent://growth-hacker
> 
> Install all? [Y/n]
```

### Self-Improving OS

```yaml
# In experimental mode
learning_os:
  observe:
    - "Track context usage patterns"
    - "Monitor success rates"
    
  adapt:
    - "Suggest better contexts"
    - "Create custom combinations"
    
  evolve:
    - "Generate new contexts"
    - "Test variations"
    - "Share discoveries"
```

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Instant customization** - Change entire OS behavior instantly
- **Perfect portability** - Take your OS anywhere
- **Community power** - Benefit from collective intelligence
- **Zero lock-in** - Just contexts, fully transparent

### For Developers
- **Package once** - Works everywhere Kingly runs
- **Monetization** - Sell premium contexts
- **Easy testing** - Contexts are isolated
- **Rapid iteration** - No core changes needed

### For Organizations
- **Standardization** - Deploy company OS
- **Compliance** - Contexts enforce policies
- **Knowledge sharing** - Contexts capture expertise
- **Cost savings** - Reuse across teams

## The Revolution

```yaml
paradigm_shift:
  old_way:
    - "Install software"
    - "Configure settings"
    - "Learn tool"
    - "Locked in"
    
  context_way:
    - "Compose behaviors"
    - "Share experiences"
    - "OS learns you"
    - "Infinite freedom"
```

*Kingly OS: Where the operating system is just a collection of contexts, and every context makes you more powerful. The community builds the OS, the OS adapts to you, and intelligence becomes truly shareable.*

## Next: Package Management Design

Ready to design how contexts are packaged, versioned, and distributed!
