# 🎨 CONTEXT GALLERY & DISTRIBUTION SPECIFICATION

*Copy-paste intelligence patterns with AI-generated variations and live preview*

## 📋 **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Revolutionary context sharing system combining shadcn copy-paste philosophy with AI-generated variations
**Value**: Users own their intelligence (not rent it), can preview and customize contexts before copying, builds community ecosystem
**Priority**: Medium - Future vision for context ecosystem and community

## Core Philosophy

```yaml
principles:
  - "Copy > Import" - Own your intelligence
  - "Transparent > Black box" - See what you get
  - "Variations > Single option" - AI generates choices
  - "Community > Isolation" - Share and remix
  - "Preview > Blind install" - Try before copying
```

## 🎯 **Acceptance Criteria**

### **AC-GALLERY-001: Live Context Preview**
```yaml
Given: User wants to add a new agent/theme/pattern
When: They run "kingly generate agent 'code reviewer'"
Then: Browser opens with 3+ live variations
And: Each variation shows in a simulator
And: User can chat with agents in real-time
And: Changes reflect immediately in preview
And: Selection copies context to local project
```

### **AC-GALLERY-002: Test Drive Mode**
```yaml
Given: User browsing context gallery
When: They click "Test Drive" on any context
Then: Temporary instance spins up
And: Full interaction available without installation
And: Session recorded for comparison
And: "Promote to Production" available after testing
And: Multiple contexts can be test-driven simultaneously
```

### **AC-GALLERY-003: Fleet Testing**
```yaml
Given: User wants to compare multiple contexts
When: They select multiple agents/patterns for testing
Then: Side-by-side simulator opens
And: Same prompts sent to all contexts
And: Responses shown in parallel
And: Performance metrics displayed
And: Best performer can be promoted
```

### **AC-GALLERY-004: Live Context Building**
```yaml
Given: User creating new context through generator
When: AI generates variations
Then: User can chat with context WHILE it's being built
And: Modify behaviors through conversation
And: See changes reflected in real-time
And: Context learns from test interactions
And: Final version includes learnings
```

### **AC-GALLERY-005: Copy-Paste Distribution**
```yaml
Given: User finds context they like
When: They run "kingly add @author/context-name"
Then: Context files copied to LOCAL project
And: No external dependencies added
And: Full source code available for editing
And: Context immediately usable
And: Updates available but not forced
```

## Implementation Examples

### Interactive Context Generation

```bash
$ kingly generate agent "technical product manager"

🎨 Opening context builder...

[Browser opens at http://localhost:3210/builder]

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Building: Technical Product Manager    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Generating 3 variations...              │
│                                         │
│ [Variation 1: Systems Thinker]          │
│ Chat: "Hi! I focus on architecture..."  │
│                                         │
