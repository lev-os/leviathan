## Master Context Engine Integration

### Core Concept
Structured collection of concise, critical information loaded once and reused across all AI interactions.

### Structure
```yaml
master_context:
  personal_info: "< 200 words"
  company_info: "< 200 words"
  team_details: "< 200 words"
  culture_values: "< 200 words"
  processes_protocols: "structured frameworks"
  hobbies_personal: "< 200 words"
```

### Framework Templates
- Dalio5Step: Strategic decision-making
- OODAProcess: Rapid response cycles
- DesignThink: Creative problem solving
- GROWCoach: Goal achievement
- PreMortem: Risk assessment
- MinimizeRegret: Decision framework

## Data Federation Model

### Privacy Zones
```yaml
personal_vault:
  - health_data
  - family_info
  - private_goals
  
business_vault:
  - proprietary_data
  - client_info
  - trade_secrets
  
shared_zone:
  - productivity_patterns
  - communication_style
  - decision_frameworks
```

### Federation Rules
- Explicit user-approved sharing only
- Granular permissions per data type
- Complete audit trail
- Zero-knowledge architecture
- Encrypted boundaries

### Cascading Contexts
- Child contexts inherit from parent
- Specific contexts override general
- Privacy boundaries enforced
- Cross-context learning with consent

## Benchmarking Framework

### Dimensions
1. **Performance**
   - Latency (sub-second to 10s)
   - Throughput (QPS)
   - Token efficiency

2. **Accuracy**
   - Semantic search relevance
   - Relationship traversal
   - Temporal reasoning

3. **Scalability**
   - Data volume (1KB to 1TB)
   - Concurrent users (1 to 10K)
   - Context size (200 to 1M tokens)

4. **Privacy**
   - Isolation testing
   - Encryption overhead
   - Compliance (GDPR, CCPA)

### Test Scenarios
- Master context loading
- Cross-memory federated queries
- Real-world workflows
- Privacy boundary testing

## Unified Memory Interface

```yaml
memory_tools:
  memory_query:
    description: "Intelligent routing to appropriate system"
    parameters:
      query: "string"
      intent_type: "semantic | relationship | document"
      constraints: "speed | accuracy | privacy"
    
  memory_store:
    description: "Store in appropriate system(s)"
    parameters:
      data: "object"
      relationships: "array"
      storage_hints: "vector | graph | document"

  memory_federated_search:
    description: "Search across all systems"
    parameters:
      systems: ["vector", "graph", "document"]
      merge_strategy: "union | intersection | ranked"
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (Week 1-2)
- OpenMemory MCP setup
- Basic Master Context Engine
- Simple federation rules
- Baseline benchmarking

### Phase 2: Multi-Memory (Week 3-4)
- Pinecone integration
- Neo4j for relationships
- Unified routing layer
- Comprehensive benchmarks

### Phase 3: Advanced (Week 5-6)
- Neural Graffiti evolution
- PathRAG reasoning
- Context cascading
- A/B testing

### Phase 4: Federation (Week 7-8)
- Complete privacy model
- Cross-context intelligence
- Performance optimization
- Production readiness

## Key Design Decisions

### Information Siloing Prevention
- Federated search across all systems
- LLM-based intelligent routing
- Redundancy for critical memories
- Parallel queries with result fusion

### System Selection Logic
- Use case requirements (speed vs accuracy)
- Data characteristics (size, relationships)
- Privacy constraints (local vs cloud)
- Cost considerations

### Integration Benefits
- No siloing through federation
- Best tool for each job
- Performance through parallelism
- Evolution through A/B testing
