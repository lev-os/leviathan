# 📊 DECISION LOGGING & ANALYTICS (Future Vision)

*Captured from i-behave.md - for post-V1 implementation*

## 🎯 **CONCEPT**

Every decision logged with success metrics to build learning patterns over time.

## 📈 **LOGGING FORMAT**

```yaml
decision_log:
  timestamp: "2025-01-25T15:30:00Z"
  user_request: "build a dashboard"
  routing_decision: "ceo → architect → dev"
  turns_to_completion: 12
  success_rate: 0.85
  user_satisfaction: 4/5
```

## 🧠 **LEARNING MECHANISM**

- Track patterns at MCP layer
- Build user preference models
- Improve routing decisions
- Measure workflow effectiveness

## ⏰ **IMPLEMENTATION TIMING**

**Prerequisites**:
- Stable MCP system
- User feedback collection
- Analytics infrastructure
- Pattern recognition system

**Priority**: V2+, when we need optimization based on usage data
