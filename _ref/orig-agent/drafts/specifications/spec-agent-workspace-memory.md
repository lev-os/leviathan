# Agent Workspace Memory Specification

## Business Case
Different agents need specialized context within each workspace. A CEO agent should remember business decisions and stakeholder concerns, while a Dev agent should remember architecture choices and technical debt. This specialized memory enables more effective agent handoffs and context continuity.

## Core Concept
Each agent maintains a separate memory file per workspace, storing context relevant to their role. Memory is structured, searchable, and automatically updated during task execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given an agent working in a workspace
**When** the agent completes a task or makes a decision
**Then** the system should:
- Update the agent's memory file for that workspace
- Store role-relevant context (business decisions for CEO, tech choices for Dev)
- Tag memories for easy retrieval
- Maintain chronological order of decisions

### Given an agent is assigned to a workspace
**When** the agent begins work
**Then** it should:
- Load its existing memory for that workspace
- Reference previous decisions in its reasoning
- Maintain consistency with past choices
- Escalate conflicts to appropriate stakeholders

### Given multiple agents working in the same workspace
**When** an agent needs cross-functional context
**Then** it should:
- Access other agents' public memories
- Respect privacy boundaries for sensitive information
- Synthesize relevant context for current task

## Memory Structure
```

    .agents/
      ceo-memory.yaml
      dev-memory.yaml
      designer-memory.yaml
```

## Agent-Specific Memory Types

### CEO Agent Memory
- Business rationale for major decisions
- Stakeholder feedback and concerns
- Resource allocation decisions
- Strategic pivots and reasoning

### Dev Agent Memory
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Technical debt acknowledgments
- Library and framework choices
- Performance optimization notes

### Designer Agent Memory
- User research insights
- Design system decisions
- Accessibility considerations
- Brand alignment notes

## Implementation Notes
- Memory files are YAML with timestamp, tags, and content
- Automatic updates during task completion
- Search functionality for quick context retrieval
- Privacy controls for sensitive agent decisions
