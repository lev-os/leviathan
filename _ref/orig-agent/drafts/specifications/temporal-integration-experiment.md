# Temporal + Kingly Integration Experiment

## Overview

This experiment explores integrating Temporal workflow orchestration into Kingly's existing agent system to add durability, scalability, and advanced orchestration capabilities while preserving Kingly's core intelligence and LLM-first architecture.

## Current State Analysis

### Kingly Architecture (Existing)
- **Agent System**: 18 specialized agents with YAML definitions
- **Routing**: Confidence-based task splitting at 80% threshold
- **Memory**: Working, episodic, semantic, and procedural memory types
- **MCP Integration**: Production-ready tool execution and communication
- **Hot Reload**: Real-time agent definition updates
- **Universal Context**: LLM-first architecture with dynamic context loading

### Temporal AI Agent Patterns (Researched)
- **Durable Workflows**: Persistent execution state across restarts
- **Signal/Query System**: Real-time communication and state inspection
- **Activity Framework**: Pluggable tool execution with retry policies
- **Continue-as-New**: Long-running workflow state management
- **Event-Driven Coordination**: Signal-based cross-workflow communication

### Integration Opportunity
Instead of Temporal calling Kingly, **Kingly uses Temporal** as its orchestration backbone to enhance existing capabilities with persistence, durability, and advanced coordination.

## Enhanced Architecture Design

### Core Integration Points

#### 1. Durable Agent Workflows
```javascript
// Current: Ephemeral agent execution
await executeAgent('CEO', task)

// Enhanced: Durable workflow execution
const agentWorkflow = await temporal.workflow.start(AgentOrchestrationWorkflow, {
  taskId: 'strategic_planning_2024',
  initialAgent: 'CEO', 
  task: task,
  context: projectContext
})

// Benefits: Survives restarts, queryable state, resumable execution
```

#### 2. Cross-Agent Coordination
```javascript
@workflow.defn
class MultiAgentWorkflow {
  async execute(complexTask) {
    // Parallel agent execution
    const [strategicAnalysis, technicalAssessment, marketResearch] = await Promise.all([
      workflow.executeActivity(executeCEO, complexTask),
      workflow.executeActivity(executeDev, complexTask),
      workflow.executeActivity(executeAnalyst, complexTask)
    ])
    
    // Coordinated synthesis with handoffs
    const synthesis = await workflow.executeActivity(executeParliament, {
      strategic: strategicAnalysis,
      technical: technicalAssessment,
      research: marketResearch
    })
    
    return synthesis
  }
}
```

#### 3. Persistent Memory Management
```javascript
@workflow.defn
class ProjectMemoryWorkflow {
  async run(projectId) {
    this.workingMemory = new Map()
    this.episodicMemory = []
    this.semanticMemory = new Map()
    this.proceduralMemory = new Map()
    
    // Memory persists across agent sessions
    // Real-time queryable state
    // Automatic memory consolidation
  }
  
  @workflow.query
  getMemory(type, key) {
    return this[`${type}Memory`].get(key)
  }
  
  @workflow.signal
  updateMemory(type, key, value) {
    this[`${type}Memory`].set(key, value)
    this.episodicMemory.push({
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      type,
      key,
      value,
      context: this.getCurrentContext()
    })
  }
}
```

#### 4. Event-Driven Agent Coordination
```javascript
@workflow.defn
class ReactiveAgentWorkflow {
  async run(projectId) {
    // Wait for external events
    while (true) {
      const event = await workflow.waitForSignal(['codeChange', 'marketUpdate', 'userFeedback'])
      
      // Route to appropriate agent based on event type
      let analysis
      switch (event.type) {
        case 'codeChange':
          analysis = await workflow.executeActivity(executeDev, event.data)
          break
        case 'marketUpdate':
          analysis = await workflow.executeActivity(executeCEO, event.data)
          break
        case 'userFeedback':
          analysis = await workflow.executeActivity(executeAnalyst, event.data)
          break
      }
      
      // Cascade insights to other agents if significant
      if (analysis.significance > 0.7) {
        await workflow.signal(ProjectCoordinationWorkflow, 'significantInsight', {
          source: event.type,
          analysis: analysis,
          recommendations: analysis.recommendations
        })
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Kingly Capabilities

#### Long-Running Strategic Sessions
```javascript
// Multi-day strategic planning with checkpoints
const strategyWorkflow = await kingly.temporal.start(StrategicPlanningWorkflow, {
  duration: '7 days',
  participants: ['CEO', 'Analyst', 'Dev', 'Parliament'],
  checkpoints: ['daily', 'milestone'],
  deliverables: ['strategy_doc', 'implementation_plan', 'risk_assessment']
})

// Query progress anytime
const progress = await strategyWorkflow.query('getPlanningProgress')
const insights = await strategyWorkflow.query('getCurrentInsights')
```

#### Cross-Project Intelligence
```javascript
@workflow.defn
class CrossProjectIntelligence {
  async run(projects) {
    // Analyze patterns across multiple projects
    const projectAnalyses = await Promise.all(
      projects.map(project => workflow.executeActivity(analyzeProjectHealth, project))
    )
    
    // Generate cross-project insights
    const patterns = await workflow.executeActivity(identifyPatterns, projectAnalyses)
    const recommendations = await workflow.executeActivity(generateRecommendations, patterns)
    
    // Distribute insights to relevant projects
    for (const recommendation of recommendations) {
      await workflow.signal(
        `project_${recommendation.projectId}`, 
        'crossProjectInsight', 
        recommendation
      )
    }
    
    // Schedule periodic re-analysis
    await workflow.sleep('24 hours')
    await workflow.continueAsNew(projects)
  }
}
```
