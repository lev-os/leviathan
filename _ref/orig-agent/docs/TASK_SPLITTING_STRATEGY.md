# Task Splitting Strategy

## 🎯 Splitting Philosophy

Each implementation ticket should be:
- **2-4 hours** of work with AI assistance
- **Self-contained** - can be tested independently
- **Sequential** - clear dependencies
- **Atomic** - one clear deliverable

## 📋 Proposed Ticket Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation (Critical Path)
1. **Universal Context Loader** - Load context.yaml with inheritance
2. **MCP Server Setup** - Basic server with tool registration
3. **State Manager** - Simple state persistence for workflows
4. **Workflow Engine Core** - Load and execute workflow definitions
5. **Meta Language Parser** - Parse workflow templates

### Phase 2: Core Features
6. **Intent Classifier Service** - LLM-based classification (already exists, needs adaptation)
7. **Task Entity with Intent** - Add intent to existing Task entity
8. **Basic Memory Storage** - File-based memory context
9. **Context Assembly Engine** - Dynamic context building
10. **MCP Tool Handlers** - Implement callback tools

### Phase 3: Bi-directional Patterns
11. **Chain of Thought Workflow** - First complete workflow
12. **Callback Pattern Implementation** - Tool response structure
13. **Context Request Tools** - requestContext implementation
14. **Workflow State Persistence** - Save/restore workflow state

### Phase 4: Agent Integration
15. **Nano Agent Base** - Minimal agent structure
16. **Agent Registry** - Register and manage agents
17. **Spawn System Integration** - Connect to existing spawn
18. **Agent Context Assembly** - Agent-specific contexts

## 🔍 Splitting Criteria

### When to Split
- Spec > 300 lines of expected code
- Multiple unrelated responsibilities
- Different testing requirements
- Can be deployed independently

### When NOT to Split
- Tightly coupled logic
- < 100 lines of code
- Single acceptance criteria
- Shared state requirements

## 📊 Example Split Analysis

**Universal Context Architecture Spec**
- Could split into:
  1. Context loader (file operations)
  2. Inheritance resolver (logic)
  3. YAML parser integration
- Decision: Keep together - tightly coupled

**MCP Nexus Spec**
- Could split into:
  1. Server setup
  2. Tool registration
  3. Protocol handling
- Decision: Split - different concerns

## 🎯 Implementation Order Rationale

1. **Context first** - Everything depends on it
2. **MCP infrastructure** - Enables bi-directional
3. **Workflows** - Core value proposition
4. **Memory** - Enhances capabilities
5. **Agents** - Build on foundation

## ✅ Ready to Create Tickets?

This strategy ensures:
- Clear dependencies
- Manageable chunks
- Testable components
- No blocking issues

Should I proceed with creating the implementation tickets based on this strategy?
