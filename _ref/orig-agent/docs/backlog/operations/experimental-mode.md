# ðŸ§ª EXPERIMENTAL MODE SYSTEM SPECIFICATION

*System-level feature flags for research capabilities and self-testing*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: System-level experimental mode for safe research, self-testing, and development features isolation
**Value**: Enables system evolution and research capabilities without compromising production stability or security
**Priority**: High - Essential for safe system self-improvement and research

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-EXP-001: System-Level Feature Isolation**
```yaml
Given: System running in experimental mode
When: Experimental features are enabled
Then: Features only activate in isolated experimental environment
And: Production contexts remain unaffected by experimental behaviors
And: System maintains clear separation between modes
```

### **AC-EXP-002: Self-Testing Capabilities**
```yaml
Given: System in experimental mode with self-testing enabled
When: System needs to validate new capabilities or changes
Then: System can create test contexts and validate behaviors autonomously
And: Self-testing generates reports on system capabilities and limitations
And: Test results inform system evolution and improvement
```

### **AC-EXP-003: Research-Safe Zero-Config Agents**
```yaml
Given: Experimental mode enabled for research purposes
When: System encounters unknown requirements or edge cases
Then: System can spawn zero-config agents for exploration
And: Experimental agents operate only within research boundaries
And: Agent behaviors and results are captured for analysis
```

## Why System-Level Feature

```yaml
# NOT over-engineering because:
reasons:
  - security: "Some features are unsafe for production"
  - performance: "Research modes may consume excessive resources"
  - determinism: "Experimental features may be non-deterministic"
  - testing: "System needs to test itself in isolation"
  
# If it was just a context setting:
problems:
  - accidental_activation: "One context enables, affects whole system"
  - no_isolation: "Research behaviors leak into production"
  - testing_paradox: "Can't test the testing system"
```

## Architecture

### System Configuration

```yaml
# kingly-config.yaml (system level)
system:
  mode: "production"  # production | experimental | research
  
  experimental_features:
    zero_config_agents:
      enabled: false
      description: "Agents start with no prompt"
      
    self_testing:
      enabled: false
      description: "LLM can run tests on itself"
      
    synthetic_generation:
      enabled: false
      description: "Create new context types on demand"
      
    pattern_mutation:
      enabled: false
      description: "Evolve patterns through variation"
      
    recursive_improvement:
      enabled: false
      description: "System modifies its own code"
```

### Mode Behaviors

```yaml
production_mode:
  agent_initialization:
    base_prompt: "~500-1000 tokens scaffolding"
    pattern_library: "loaded"
    safety_checks: "enabled"
    
  context_creation:
    validation: "strict"
    types: "predefined only"
    
  testing:
    isolation: "full"
    self_modification: "disabled"

experimental_mode:
  agent_initialization:
    base_prompt: "0-100 tokens or none"
    pattern_library: "optional"
    safety_checks: "relaxed"
    
  context_creation:
    validation: "flexible"
    types: "dynamic generation allowed"
    
  testing:
    isolation: "partial"
    self_modification: "monitored"
    
research_mode:
  # Everything enabled, no limits
  # Not recommended outside controlled environments
```

### Self-Testing Capabilities

```yaml
experimental_self_testing:
  llm_test_generation:
    # LLM can create test contexts
    capabilities:
      - create_test_scenarios
      - modify_test_parameters
      - evaluate_own_performance
      
  test_execution:
    # LLM runs tests on itself
    process:
      - generate: "hypothesis about behavior"
      - create: "test context to verify"
      - execute: "run test in isolation"
      - analyze: "compare expected vs actual"
      - learn: "update patterns based on results"
      
  recursive_testing:
    # Tests testing the test system
    levels:
      - test_basic_functionality
      - test_test_creation
      - test_test_evaluation
      - test_learning_from_tests
```

### Zero-Config Agent Example

```yaml
# In experimental mode
zero_config_agent:
  initialization:
    base_prompt: null  # Literally nothing
    
  learning_process:
    interaction_1:
      user: "Help me write code"
      agent: "I need more context. What kind of code?"
      learning: "Users want specificity"
      
    interaction_10:
      user: "Help me write code"
      agent: "I can help! What language and what should it do?"
      learning: "Accumulated helpful patterns"
      
    interaction_100:
      # Agent has learned optimal patterns
      # Now performs like scaffolded agent
      # But patterns are user-specific
```

### Pattern Mutation Research

```yaml
experimental_evolution:
  pattern_library:
    base_patterns: ["agile/scrum", "coding/tdd"]
    
  mutation_engine:
    operations:
      - crossover: "Combine patterns"
      - mutation: "Random variations"
      - selection: "Keep successful variants"
      
  example_evolution:
    generation_1: "Standard scrum pattern"
    generation_10: "Scrum + async elements"
    generation_50: "Novel workflow discovered"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Feature Flag System

```javascript
// System-level feature checking
class ExperimentalMode {
  static isEnabled(feature) {
    // Check system config, not context
    return systemConfig.experimental_features[feature]?.enabled;
  }
  
  static withFeature(feature, callback) {
    if (this.isEnabled(feature)) {
      // Execute with monitoring
      return monitor.track(feature, callback);
    }
    return null;
  }
}

// Usage in agent initialization
if (ExperimentalMode.isEnabled('zero_config_agents')) {
  // Start with no prompt
  agent.prompt = null;
} else {
  // Load standard scaffolding
  agent.prompt = await loadScaffold(agentType);
}
```

### Isolation Boundaries

```yaml
experimental_isolation:
  filesystem:
    production: "~/.kingly/"
    experimental: "~/.kingly-experimental/"
    
  context_separation:
    production_contexts: "cannot reference experimental"
    experimental_contexts: "can reference production read-only"
    
  rollback:
    automatic: "on error or instability"
    manual: "kingly experimental --rollback"
```

### Monitoring & Safety

```yaml
experimental_monitoring:
  metrics:
    - resource_usage
    - error_rates
    - pattern_stability
    - learning_convergence
    
  safety_limits:
    - max_recursion_depth: 10
    - max_context_creation_rate: 100/min
    - max_self_modification: "monitored only"
    
  emergency_stop:
    triggers:
      - resource_exhaustion
      - error_spiral
      - divergent_behavior
```

## Usage Examples

### Research Mode Activation

```bash
# Enable experimental mode system-wide
kingly experimental --enable

# Enable specific features
kingly experimental --feature zero_config_agents --enable
kingly experimental --feature self_testing --enable

# Run in research mode (all features)
kingly research --confirm-risks
```

### Self-Testing Example

```yaml
# LLM creates test for itself
test_context:
  name: "Test CEO intent recognition"
  setup:
    - create: "CEO agent context"
    - configure: "experimental mode"
  
  test:
    input: "I need to build a SaaS platform"
    expected:
      intent_type: "business_growth"
      confidence: "> 0.7"
      suggested_approach: "project structure"
      
  learn_from_result:
    if_failed: "Adjust intent recognition patterns"
    if_passed: "Reinforce current patterns"
```
