# üîó CROSS-CONTEXT DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT SPECIFICATION

*Dependency tracking and resolution across workspace and context boundaries*

## üìã **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Dependency management system that handles relationships across any context boundary
**Value**: Enables shared business goals and cross-workspace coordination without architectural limitations
**Priority**: High - Foundation for universal scaling and context cascade dependencies

## üéØ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-CDM-001: Universal Dependency References**
```yaml
Given: Context or task with dependencies across any boundary
When: Dependency is defined or resolved
Then: System supports references across workspace, project, and universal contexts
And: Dependency resolution handles inheritance chain relationships
And: Cross-workspace dependencies are tracked and validated
And: Dependency changes propagate appropriately through context cascade
```

## üåê **DEPENDENCY REFERENCE PATTERNS**

```yaml
reference_types:
  relative_references:
    pattern: "../sibling-context"
    usage: "References within same parent context"
    resolution: "Navigate relative to current context location"
    
  absolute_references:
    pattern: "/workspace/project/context"
    usage: "References from workspace root"
    resolution: "Navigate from workspace root directory"
    
  workspace_references:
    pattern: "workspace:other-workspace/project/context"
    usage: "Cross-workspace dependencies"
    resolution: "Navigate to different workspace root, then resolve path"
    
  universal_references:
    pattern: "universal:user-authentication"
    usage: "Shared business goal contexts"
    resolution: "Reference to universal business goal context library"
```

## üîÑ **DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION ENGINE**

```yaml
resolution_process:
  step_1_reference_parsing:
    input: "Dependency reference string"
    process: "Parse reference type and path components"
    output: "Structured reference with type and location"
    
  step_2_context_validation:
    input: "Structured reference"
    process: "Verify referenced context exists and is accessible"
    output: "Validated dependency with metadata"
    
  step_3_inheritance_analysis:
    input: "Validated dependency"
    process: "Analyze inheritance chain impact of dependency"
    output: "Dependency with inheritance implications"
    
  step_4_circular_dependency_check:
    input: "All context dependencies"
    process: "Detect circular references and suggest resolution"
    output: "Dependency graph with cycle detection"
```

## üåä **CROSS-WORKSPACE COORDINATION**

```yaml
cross_workspace_patterns:
  shared_business_goals:
    example: "universal:user-authentication referenced by multiple workspaces"
    coordination: "Universal business goal provides shared requirements"
    updates: "Changes to universal goal propagate to all implementers"
    
  shared_infrastructure:
    example: "workspace:company-shared/design-system referenced by client workspaces"
    coordination: "Shared implementation used across client projects"
    updates: "Infrastructure changes notify all dependent contexts"
    
  cross_client_learnings:
    example: "Breakthrough in client-abc/optimization propagates to client-def"
    coordination: "Learning patterns bubble up through context hierarchy"
    updates: "Opportunity analysis triggers cross-workspace application"
```

This enables unlimited context coordination while maintaining clean boundaries!
