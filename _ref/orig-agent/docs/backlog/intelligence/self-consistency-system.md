# Self-Consistency System

## Overview
Implementation specification for Self-Consistency reasoning that generates multiple solution paths through **parallel bidirectional MCP calls**, ensuring each path gets FULL reasoning power for maximum diversity.

## Background
Traditional self-consistency crams all paths into one context, producing similar variations. Our approach uses **bidirectional MCP architecture** where:
- Each reasoning path gets its own MCP call with FULL capacity
- Paths explore genuinely different approaches (not variations)
- Consensus emerges from truly independent reasoning
- **10x more robust** validation through dedicated compute per path

## Goals
- Generate multiple diverse reasoning paths
- Implement robust consensus mechanisms
- Filter low-quality paths before consensus
- Scale to 10x+ validation robustness

## Detailed Design

### MCP Tool Implementation
```javascript
export const selfConsistencyTools = {
  create_reasoning_path: {
    parameters: {
      problem_statement: { type: "string", required: true },
      sampling_temperature: { type: "number", default: 0.8 },
      path_index: { type: "number", required: true }
    }
  },

  evaluate_reasoning_quality: {
    parameters: {
      reasoning_path: { type: "object", required: true },
      quality_criteria: { type: "array", required: true }
    }
  },

  compute_answer_distribution: {
    parameters: {
      quality_paths: { type: "array", required: true },
      consensus_method: { type: "string", default: "frequency_weighted" }
    }
  }
};
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-SCS-001: Independent Path Generation**
```yaml
Given: Problem requiring validation through 10 reasoning paths
When: Self-consistency generates solution paths
Then: Each path gets its own dedicated MCP call
And: Each path has FULL model reasoning capacity
And: Paths produce genuinely diverse approaches
```

### **AC-SCS-002: Quality-Based Consensus**
```yaml
Given: 10 completed reasoning paths with solutions
When: Consensus mechanism is applied
Then: Low-quality paths filtered (score < 0.7)
And: Remaining paths vote on final answer
And: Confidence reflects consensus strength
```

### **AC-SCS-003: Adaptive Path Scaling**
```yaml
Given: High-stakes problem requiring extra validation
When: Initial consensus is weak (<60% agreement)
Then: System spawns additional MCP calls for more paths
And: Continues until strong consensus or path limit
And: Total validation robustness scales with compute
```
