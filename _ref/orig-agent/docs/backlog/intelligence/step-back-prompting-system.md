# Step-Back Prompting System

## Overview
Implementation specification for Step-Back Prompting using **bidirectional MCP architecture** where principle extraction and application each get FULL reasoning power through dedicated calls.

## Background
Traditional step-back prompting dilutes attention between abstraction and application. Our approach uses **bidirectional MCP calls** where:
- High-level principle extraction gets dedicated MCP call
- Principle application uses separate full-power reasoning
- Concrete problem solving has focused attention
- **3x-5x better** abstraction through dedicated compute
Step-Back Prompting improves accuracy by up to 36%.

## Goals
- Extract relevant principles before problem-solving
- Validate principle correctness and relevance
- Apply principles systematically to solutions
- Enable knowledge transfer across similar problems

## Detailed Design

### MCP Tool Implementation
```javascript
export const stepBackTools = {
  identify_relevant_principles: {
    parameters: {
      problem_statement: { type: "string", required: true },
      domain_context: { type: "string" }
    }
  },

  validate_extracted_principles: {
    parameters: {
      extracted_principles: { type: "array", required: true },
      original_problem: { type: "string", required: true }
    }
  },

  principle_guided_reasoning: {
    parameters: {
      validated_principles: { type: "array", required: true },
      original_problem: { type: "string", required: true }
    }
  }
};
```

## Behavioral Design (BDD)
```gherkin
Feature: Principle-First Reasoning
  As a user solving domain-specific problems
  I want principle extraction before solutions
  So that reasoning is grounded and transferable

  Scenario: Physics problem solving
    Given a complex physics problem
    When step-back prompting is applied
    Then relevant physical laws are identified
    And principles are validated for correctness
    And solution explicitly uses these principles
```
