# ðŸ”— DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS SPECIFICATION

*LLM-driven task dependency management and optimization*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Enable LLM to analyze and manage task dependencies intelligently
**Value**: Optimal task sequencing and dependency validation through natural language understanding
**Priority**: Medium - Enhanced project coordination and task organization

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-DEPENDENCY-001: LLM Dependency Recognition**
```yaml
Given: Multiple related tasks are created or analyzed
When: LLM evaluates task relationships and dependencies
Then: LLM identifies natural dependency relationships between tasks
And: LLM recognizes blocking, parallel, and optional dependencies
And: LLM validates dependency logic using natural reasoning
And: No hardcoded dependency detection algorithms are used
```

### **AC-DEPENDENCY-002: Dependency Cycle Prevention**
```yaml
Given: LLM identifies task dependencies
When: LLM analyzes dependency chain for logical consistency
Then: LLM detects potential circular dependencies using reasoning
And: LLM suggests dependency restructuring to resolve cycles
And: LLM validates final dependency structure is logically sound
And: Cycle detection uses LLM intelligence, not graph algorithms
```

### **AC-DEPENDENCY-003: Task Sequencing Optimization**
```yaml
Given: Tasks with validated dependencies exist
When: LLM determines optimal execution sequence
Then: LLM creates logical task ordering based on dependency analysis
And: LLM identifies tasks that can be executed in parallel
And: LLM prioritizes critical path tasks for efficient completion
And: Sequencing decisions use LLM reasoning about task relationships
```

### **AC-DEPENDENCY-004: Dependency Impact Analysis**
```yaml
Given: Task dependencies are established
When: Changes occur to tasks or requirements
Then: LLM analyzes impact of changes on dependent tasks
And: LLM identifies tasks that need updates due to dependency changes
And: LLM suggests mitigation strategies for dependency conflicts
And: Impact analysis leverages LLM understanding of task relationships
```## ðŸ§  **LLM-FIRST DEPENDENCY INTELLIGENCE**

### **Natural Dependency Recognition**
```yaml
dependency_types:
  blocking: "Task A must complete before Task B can start"
  parallel: "Tasks can execute simultaneously without conflict"
  optional: "Task B benefits from Task A but doesn't require it"
  conditional: "Task B only needed if Task A reveals specific requirements"

llm_analysis_patterns:
  technical_dependencies: "Database schema before API endpoints before frontend"
  business_dependencies: "Market research before feature specification before implementation"
  resource_dependencies: "Infrastructure setup before deployment tasks"
  knowledge_dependencies: "Research tasks before implementation decisions"
```

### **Dependency Reasoning Framework**
```yaml
llm_dependency_evaluation:
  logical_analysis: |
    "Does Task B require outputs/decisions from Task A?"
    "Can these tasks execute simultaneously without conflicts?"
    "What happens if Task A changes - does Task B need updates?"
    
  conflict_detection: |
    "Do these tasks compete for same resources?"
    "Would parallel execution create inconsistencies?"
    "Are there shared components that could cause issues?"
    
  optimization_opportunities: |
    "Which tasks form the critical path?"
    "What tasks can be parallelized safely?"
    "Where can we reduce overall completion time?"
```

## ðŸ”§ **DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS TOOLS**

### **MCP Tool Support (Data Access Only)**
```yaml
dependency_tools:
  analyze_task_dependencies:
    purpose: "LLM analyzes relationships between specified tasks"
    input: "List of task IDs or descriptions"
    output: "Dependency analysis with reasoning"
    
  validate_dependency_chain:
    purpose: "LLM validates logical consistency of dependency structure"
    input: "Proposed dependency relationships"
    output: "Validation results with suggestions"
    
  optimize_task_sequence:
    purpose: "LLM determines optimal execution ordering"
    input: "Tasks with dependencies"
    output: "Optimized sequence with parallel execution opportunities"
```

### **Dependency Context Injection**
```javascript
const dependencyAwarenessPlugin = {
  name: 'dependency-awareness',
  always: async (context) => {
    if (multipleTasksDetected(context)) {
      context.result.agentInstructions += `
      
ðŸ”— DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS AVAILABLE:
Consider relationships between tasks:
- Which tasks must complete before others can start?
- Which tasks can execute in parallel?
- Are there circular dependencies to resolve?

Use your reasoning to analyze task relationships and optimize sequence.`;
    }
  }
};
```

## ðŸ’¡ **IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS**

### **Dependency Documentation Structure**
```yaml
task_dependencies:
  task_id: "auth-frontend"
  depends_on: 
    - task: "auth-backend"
      type: "blocking"
      reason: "Frontend needs API endpoints to integrate with"
    - task: "ui-design"
      type: "optional" 
      reason: "Design improves UX but not required for functionality"
      
  blocks:
    - task: "user-profile"
      reason: "Profile features require authentication to be working"
```

### **LLM Dependency Analysis Flow**
```
1. LLM analyzes task descriptions and requirements
2. LLM identifies logical dependencies using reasoning
3. LLM validates dependency structure for cycles/conflicts
4. LLM suggests optimal execution sequence
5. LLM documents dependency rationale for future reference
```

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING APPROACH**

**Unit Tests**: Dependency tool responses, context injection
**Integration Tests**: Multi-task dependency analysis, sequence optimization
**E2E Tests**: Complete project with complex dependency chains
