# ðŸ§  INTENT RECOGNITION ENGINE SPECIFICATION

*LLM-driven intent classification and routing system*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Intelligent intent recognition that routes human expressions to appropriate execution patterns
**Value**: Universal understanding of human needs from "order pizza" to "reform taxation" 
**Priority**: High - Core intelligence for universal AGI coordination

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-INTENT-001: Universal Intent Processing**
```yaml
Given: Any human expression of desire, need, or goal
When: Intent recognition engine processes input
Then: Intent is extracted and classified by type
And: Complexity analysis determines appropriate routing
And: Context cascade is initiated for implementation
And: Same engine handles personal to civilizational scale
```

## âš¡ **INTENT CLASSIFICATION MATRIX**

```yaml
intent_types:
  personal_experience:
    patterns: ["I want", "I need", "help me", "plan my", "organize my"]
    complexity_factors: ["personal preferences", "time constraints", "resource availability"]
    routing_bias: "one_shot to mini_workflow"
    
  business_growth: 
    patterns: ["users need", "customers want", "build feature", "increase revenue"]
    complexity_factors: ["technical requirements", "user experience", "business logic"]
    routing_bias: "mini_workflow to project_structure"
    
  organizational_coordination:
    patterns: ["team needs", "process improvement", "workflow optimization", "strategy"]
    complexity_factors: ["stakeholder alignment", "change management", "coordination"]
    routing_bias: "project_structure to multi_project"
    
  civilizational_impact:
    patterns: ["society needs", "global problem", "systemic change", "governance"]
    complexity_factors: ["multi-jurisdiction", "political considerations", "scale challenges"]
    routing_bias: "multi_project to multi_workspace"
```

## ðŸ”„ **DYNAMIC ROUTING ENGINE**

```yaml
routing_analysis:
  step_1_intent_extraction:
    input: "Raw human expression"
    process: "LLM extracts core desire/need/goal"
    output: "Structured intent with confidence score"
    
  step_2_type_classification:
    input: "Structured intent"  
    process: "Pattern matching + LLM semantic analysis"
    output: "Intent_type + routing recommendations"
    
  step_3_complexity_assessment:
    factors: ["scope", "stakeholders", "dependencies", "uncertainty", "timeline"]
    process: "Multi-factor complexity scoring"
    output: "Complexity score 0.0-1.0"
    
  step_4_routing_decision:
    input: "Intent_type + complexity + context"
    logic: "Dynamic compression matrix"
    output: "Execution pathway + agent assignment"
```

This creates the intelligent front-end that understands ANY human expression and routes it appropriately!
