# Tree of Thoughts System

## Overview
Implementation specification for the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) reasoning system that explores multiple solution branches through **parallel bidirectional MCP calls**, giving each branch FULL LLM reasoning power instead of diluted attention.

## Background
Traditional ToT forces the LLM to simulate all branches internally, severely limiting exploration depth. Our approach uses **bidirectional MCP architecture** where:
- LLM plans branching strategy (e.g., 3 branches Ã— 5 levels = 15 paths)
- Each branch gets its own MCP call with FULL model capacity
- Branch evaluations flow back to guide pruning decisions
- **15x-50x more reasoning power** by giving each branch dedicated compute

## Goals
- Implement branching reasoning with configurable exploration strategies
- Enable parallel evaluation of multiple solution paths
- Provide intelligent pruning to focus on promising branches
- Support 20x+ reasoning scaling through branch multiplication

## Non-Goals
- Not replacing linear reasoning for straightforward problems
- Not supporting infinite branching (resource constraints apply)
- Not handling real-time interactive exploration

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-TOT-001: Parallel Branch Exploration**
```yaml
Given: A problem requiring exploration of 3 solution paths
When: Tree of thoughts generates branches at depth N
Then: Each branch gets its own dedicated MCP call
And: Each branch receives FULL LLM reasoning capacity
And: Branches explore genuinely different approaches
```

### **AC-TOT-002: Bidirectional Evaluation Flow**
```yaml
Given: 15 active branches across 5 tree levels
When: Branch quality evaluation is triggered
Then: Each branch evaluation uses separate MCP call
And: Evaluation scores flow back to guide pruning
And: Most promising branches selected for expansion
```

### **AC-TOT-003: Dynamic Tree Adaptation**
```yaml
Given: Branch discovering breakthrough insight
When: High-value path is identified
Then: LLM can spawn additional MCP calls for deep exploration
And: Other branches can be pruned to focus resources
And: Total reasoning power concentrates on promising paths
```
    Given a complex planning problem with multiple valid approaches
    When I request tree of thoughts reasoning with branching factor 3
    Then the system should generate 3 distinct reasoning branches
    And each branch should explore a different solution strategy
    And maintain the problem context in each branch

  Scenario: Evaluate and prune low-quality branches
    Given a reasoning tree with 6 active branches at depth 3
    When the evaluation phase runs with beam width 2
    Then each branch should receive quality scores
    And the top 2 branches should be selected for continuation
    And pruning reasons should be documented for dropped branches

  Scenario: Backtrack from dead-end branches
    Given a branch that reaches an invalid solution state
    When the system detects the dead-end through evaluation
    Then it should mark the branch as terminated
    And backtrack to explore alternative paths
    And learn from the failed approach pattern
```
