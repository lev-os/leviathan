# ðŸ§  MULTI-PERSPECTIVE VALIDATION SYSTEM SPECIFICATION

*CEO strategic intelligence examining decisions through multiple expert lenses for optimal outcomes*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: CEO agent uses multiple expert perspectives to validate high-stakes decisions through systematic analysis
**Value**: Eliminates blind spots, reduces decision risk, and ensures comprehensive strategic analysis without agent proliferation
**Priority**: High - Critical for intelligent decision-making at scale

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-VALIDATION-001: Expert Lens Adoption**
```yaml
Given: CEO needs to validate a high-stakes decision
When: Multi-perspective validation workflow is triggered
Then: CEO adopts each expert lens sequentially (legal, business, psychology, technical, adversarial)
And: Each perspective provides context clues for specialized analysis
And: CEO maintains strategic authority while channeling expert knowledge
And: All perspectives are analyzed within single coherent intelligence
```

### **AC-VALIDATION-002: Four-Round Analysis Process**
```yaml
Given: CEO examining scenario through multiple expert lenses
When: Multi-perspective validation workflow executes
Then: Round 1 captures domain-specific insights from each lens
And: Round 2 identifies conflicts and synergies between perspectives
And: Round 3 synthesizes unified strategy incorporating all concerns
And: Round 4 stress-tests final strategy against all perspectives
And: Each round builds on previous analysis for comprehensive validation
```

### **AC-VALIDATION-003: Confidence Calibration & Recursion**
```yaml
Given: Multi-perspective analysis reveals low confidence (< 0.7)
When: Confidence calibration triggers additional validation
Then: Additional analysis rounds are executed automatically
And: Complex scenarios (> 0.8 complexity) trigger recursive decomposition
And: CEO can seek external expert consultation when needed
And: Final confidence score reflects consensus across all perspectives
```

### **AC-VALIDATION-004: Auto-Trigger Integration**
```yaml
Given: CEO agent handling scenario with validation triggers
When: Financial impact > $10K OR legal implications OR strategic decision
Then: Multi-perspective validation workflow activates automatically
And: Workflow integrates seamlessly with CEO endpoint operations
And: CEO can manually invoke validation for any decision
And: Validation results inform CEO strategic recommendations
```

### **AC-VALIDATION-005: Workflow Composition**
```yaml
Given: Complex strategic scenario requiring multiple analyses
When: CEO needs comprehensive decision support
Then: Multi-perspective validation composes with document synthesis workflow
And: CEO can execute "document synthesis â†’ validation â†’ recommendation" chains
And: Recursive composition handles scenarios of any complexity
And: Workflow results integrate into unified strategic assessment
```
