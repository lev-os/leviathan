# Graph of Thoughts System

## Overview
Implementation specification for Graph of Thoughts (GoT) reasoning using arbitrary graph structures where **each node gets dedicated MCP calls**, enabling complex interconnected reasoning with FULL power at every vertex.

## Background
Traditional GoT forces internal graph simulation with severely limited complexity. Our approach uses **bidirectional MCP architecture** where:
- Each graph node is a separate MCP call with FULL capacity
- Edges represent actual data flow between reasoning nodes
- Merging/splitting happens through coordinated MCP calls
- **50x-100x more complex** graph structures possible

## Goals
- Implement flexible graph-based reasoning structure
- Enable merging of redundant reasoning paths
- Support feedback loops for iterative refinement
- Scale to 50x+ reasoning power through graph operations

## Detailed Design

## Behavioral Design (BDD)
```gherkin
Feature: Graph of Thoughts Reasoning
  As a user solving problems with complex interdependencies
  I want graph-based reasoning with relationship modeling
  So that I can handle non-linear solution spaces effectively

  Scenario: Create and connect thought nodes
    Given a problem requiring multiple interconnected concepts
    When I generate thought nodes of different types
    Then the system should identify relationships between nodes
    And create edges representing logical connections
    And support cycles for iterative refinement

  Scenario: Merge redundant reasoning paths
    Given multiple nodes representing similar concepts
    When similarity exceeds the merge threshold
    Then the system should consolidate the nodes
    And preserve important information from both
    And update all connected edges appropriately
```
