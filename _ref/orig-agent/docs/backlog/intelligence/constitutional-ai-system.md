# Constitutional AI System

## Overview
Implementation specification for Constitutional AI using **bidirectional MCP architecture** where each rule evaluation and compliance check gets FULL reasoning power through dedicated calls.

## Background
Traditional Constitutional AI evaluates all rules within limited context. Our approach uses **bidirectional MCP calls** where:
- Each constitutional principle gets dedicated evaluation call
- Compliance checking uses separate full-power reasoning
- Rule refinement happens through focused analysis
- **10x more sophisticated** ethical governance possible

## Goals
- Implement constitutional rule framework
- Enable systematic compliance checking
- Support iterative correction of violations
- Provide transparent governance audit trails

## Detailed Design

### MCP Tool Implementation
```javascript
export const constitutionalAITools = {
  activate_constitution: {
    parameters: {
      constitution_definition: { type: "object", required: true },
      enforcement_level: { type: "string", enum: ["high", "medium", "low"] }
    }
  },

  assess_constitutional_adherence: {
    parameters: {
      generated_content: { type: "string", required: true },
      active_constitution: { type: "object", required: true }
    }
  },

  create_compliant_revision: {
    parameters: {
      original_content: { type: "string", required: true },
      violation_details: { type: "array", required: true }
    }
  }
};
```

### Constitutional Framework
```yaml
constitution:
  core_principles:
    - id: "harmlessness"
      rule: "Do not provide harmful information"
      weight: 1.0
    - id: "truthfulness"
      rule: "Provide accurate, fact-based information"
      weight: 1.0
    - id: "respect"
      rule: "Treat all with dignity and respect"
      weight: 1.0
```

## Behavioral Design (BDD)
```gherkin
Feature: Constitutional Compliance
  As a user needing safe AI behavior
  I want constitutional rule enforcement
  So that outputs align with ethical principles

  Scenario: Violation detection and correction
    Given content that may violate principles
    When constitutional check is performed
    Then violations are identified with explanations
    And corrected content maintains original intent
    And compliance is verified iteratively
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-CAI-001: Principle-Level MCP Evaluation**
```yaml
Given: Constitutional AI evaluating response against 10 principles
When: Compliance checking is triggered
Then: Each principle gets dedicated MCP call for evaluation
And: Principle evaluation has FULL reasoning capacity
And: Violations detected with nuanced understanding
```

### **AC-CAI-002: Iterative Refinement Process**
```yaml
Given: Response violating constitutional principles
When: Correction is required
Then: Each refinement iteration uses separate MCP call
And: Refinements preserve original intent while fixing violations
And: Process continues until compliance achieved
```

### **AC-CAI-003: Dynamic Principle Learning**
```yaml
Given: New ethical scenario or edge case
When: Existing principles insufficient
Then: System can propose new principles via MCP reasoning
And: Principles evolve based on usage patterns
And: Governance remains transparent and auditable
```
