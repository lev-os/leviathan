# Few-Shot Learning System

## Overview
Implementation specification for dynamic Few-Shot Learning using **bidirectional MCP architecture** where example selection and pattern application each get FULL reasoning power through dedicated calls.

## Background
Traditional few-shot cramming examples into prompts limits both example quality and quantity. Our approach uses **bidirectional MCP calls** where:
- Example retrieval gets dedicated MCP call with semantic search
- Pattern extraction uses separate full-power reasoning
- Example application has focused attention per example
- **10x more effective** learning through dedicated compute

## Goals
- Implement semantic example retrieval and ranking
- Enable dynamic example selection based on query context
- Optimize context usage through intelligent selection
- Scale learning effectiveness through dedicated MCP calls

## Detailed Design

### MCP Tool Implementation
```javascript
export const fewShotLearningTools = {
  extract_query_features: {
    parameters: {
      user_query: { type: "string", required: true },
      domain_hints: { type: "string" }
    }
  },

  search_example_repository: {
    parameters: {
      query_embedding: { type: "array", required: true },
      similarity_threshold: { type: "number", default: 0.7 }
    }
  },

  optimize_example_selection: {
    parameters: {
      ranked_examples: { type: "array", required: true },
      context_budget: { type: "number", required: true }
    }
  }
};
```

### Workflow Configuration
```yaml
name: few_shot_learning_system
version: "1.0"

parameters:
  max_examples: 5
  similarity_threshold: 0.7
  adaptive_selection: true

example_repository:
  storage_type: "vector_database"
  embedding_model: "text-embedding-3-large"
```

## Behavioral Design (BDD)
```gherkin
Feature: Dynamic Few-Shot Learning
  As a user needing specialized task performance
  I want relevant examples selected automatically
  So that the AI learns patterns effectively

  Scenario: Semantic example selection
    Given a user query about data analysis
    When few-shot learning is applied
    Then relevant data analysis examples are retrieved
    And examples are ranked by semantic similarity
    And optimal subset selected within context budget
```
