# 🎨 GENERATION UI SYSTEM (GENUI) SPECIFICATION

*First-class OS feature for rich, adaptive, preference-aware interactions*

## 📋 **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Revolutionary UI generation system that creates beautiful, adaptive, preference-aware interfaces for every AI interaction
**Value**: Transform AI interactions from text walls to magical, personalized experiences that enhance intelligence and delight users
**Priority**: Medium - Future vision for human-AI interface evolution

## 🎯 **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-GENUI-001: Dynamic UI Generation**
```yaml
Given: AI needs to present information or collect input
When: Response is generated for user interaction
Then: UI is dynamically generated based on content type and user preferences
And: UI adapts to interaction complexity (simple text, rich data, interactive elements)
And: Generated UI enhances comprehension and usability
```

### **AC-GENUI-002: Context-Aware Theme Application**
```yaml
Given: User has active theme context (cyberpunk, zen-minimal, etc.)
When: UI is generated for any interaction
Then: Theme context influences UI generation (colors, typography, interaction patterns)
And: Theme maintains consistency across all system interactions
And: Theme preferences are learned and refined over time
```

### **AC-GENUI-003: Cross-Platform Adaptive Rendering**
```yaml
Given: Generated UI needs to display across different interfaces
When: Same content is presented in terminal, web, or future brain interface
Then: UI adapts appropriately to each platform's capabilities
And: Core information architecture remains consistent
And: Interactive elements translate appropriately across platforms
```

## Core Philosophy

```yaml
principles:
  - "UI is generated, not templated"
  - "Preferences are learned, not configured"  
  - "Themes are contexts, not stylesheets"
  - "Every output is interactive"
  - "Beauty enhances intelligence"
```

## Architecture

### GenUI as OS Feature

```yaml
# Not just formatting - core system capability
genui_system:
  renderers:
    terminal: "Rich markdown with ANSI"
    web: "React components from markdown"
    voice: "SSML with personality"
    neural: "Direct thought protocols"
    
  preference_engine:
    detection: "LLM recognizes preferences"
    storage: "Preferences as contexts"
    application: "Automatic UI adaptation"
    
  theme_system:
    location: "contexts/themes/"
    inheritance: "Themes can extend themes"
    switching: "Real-time theme changes"
```

### Theme Contexts

```yaml

  metadata:
    type: "preference"
    learned_from: "conversation"
    
  preferences:
    lists:
      style: "numbered"
      reason: "User explicitly stated preference"
      confidence: 0.95
      
    tables:
      style: "ascii"  # Learned from usage
      
    code:
      highlighting: "monokai"
      line_numbers: true
```

```

## 🎯 **Web UI Acceptance Criteria**

### **AC-GENUI-001: Context Simulator Interface**
```yaml
Given: User wants to test a context before installation
When: They open the web simulator
Then: Full chat interface loads
And: Context responds in real-time
And: Theme/preferences apply live
And: Performance metrics display
And: Session can be saved/shared
```

### **AC-GENUI-002: Live Context Building**
```yaml
Given: User generating new context with AI
When: Variations are being created
Then: User can chat with context DURING creation
And: Feedback influences generation
And: Changes reflect immediately
And: Context evolves through conversation
And: Final version includes learnings
```

### **AC-GENUI-003: Fleet Testing Interface**
```yaml
Given: User comparing multiple contexts
When: Fleet testing mode activated
Then: Grid layout shows all contexts
And: Synchronized prompts sent to all
And: Responses display in parallel
And: Metrics compare side-by-side
And: Best performer highlighted
```

## Web Simulator Implementation

### Context Test Drive UI

```typescript
// First GenUI web interface
interface ContextSimulator {
  // Live chat with contexts
  chat: {
    interface: "Split screen or tabbed"
    messages: "Real-time streaming"
    metrics: "Tokens, latency, confidence"
  }
  
  // Context variations
  variations: {
    display: "Carousel or grid"
    switching: "Instant, maintains chat history"
    comparison: "Side-by-side diff view"
  }
  
  // Performance dashboard
  metrics: {
    responseTime: "Graph over session"
    tokenUsage: "Running counter"
    satisfaction: "Thumb ratings"
    uniqueness: "Originality score"
  }
  
  // Actions
  actions: {
    testDrive: "Temporary instance"
    promote: "Copy to local contexts"
    modify: "Edit and retest"
    share: "Send session to others"
  }
}
```

### Browser-Based Builder

```yaml
# Real-time context creation
builder_interface:
  layout:
    left_panel: "Context definition (YAML)"
    center: "Live chat preview"
    right_panel: "Variations carousel"
    
  features:
    hot_reload: "Every keystroke updates preview"
    ai_suggestions: "Based on chat interactions"
    test_scenarios: "Pre-built conversation flows"
    
  workflow:
    1. Describe what you want
    2. AI generates 3+ variations
    3. Chat with each variation
    4. Refine through conversation
    5. Merge best features
    6. Copy final version
```

### Conversation Pattern

```
┌─ 💭 Agent Thinking ─────────────────┐
│ Analyzing complexity...             │
│ Checking dependencies...            │
│ Planning approach...                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ 🤖 Agent Response ─────────────────┐
│ This looks complex. I recommend     │
│ splitting into 3 phases...          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Northstar Implementation

```yaml
# User types anywhere in conversation
user: "I prefer dark themes and emoji-heavy responses"

# System immediately:
1. Detects preference statement
2. Creates preference context
3. Switches theme
4. Adjusts emoji usage
5. Confirms: "✨ Dark theme activated! 🌙 Extra emojis enabled! 🎉"

# All future interactions use these preferences
# No configuration needed - just natural conversation
```

## Benefits
