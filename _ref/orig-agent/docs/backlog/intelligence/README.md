## Key Innovation: Bidirectional MCP

Traditional approaches force the LLM to simulate all reasoning internally:
- Chain of Thought: 20 steps = 1/20th power per step
- Tree of Thoughts: All branches share context
- Multi-Agent: Role-playing dilutes expertise

Our approach gives each reasoning unit its own MCP call:
- Chain of Thought: 20 steps = 20x full power
- Tree of Thoughts: Each branch = dedicated reasoning
- Multi-Agent: Each agent = specialized expertise

## Implementation Dependencies

Most intelligence systems depend on:
1. Core foundation (task structure, MCP nexus)
2. Memory MVP for context storage
3. Confidence system for assessment
