# ðŸš¨ RISK VALIDATION WORKFLOW SPECIFICATION

*Systematic risk identification and escalation during planning phases*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Automated risk identification and escalation system that prevents invalid assumptions from reaching implementation
**Value**: Catch architectural misunderstandings early, ensure accurate risk assessment, improve planning confidence
**Priority**: High - Critical for accurate project planning and resource allocation

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-RISK-001: Real-Time Risk Validation During Planning**
```yaml
Given: CEO agent performing technical architecture planning
When: Risk assessment is generated during multi-perspective analysis
Then: Each identified risk triggers immediate validation workflow
And: Technical feasibility of risk scenarios is verified against architecture
And: Invalid risks are flagged and removed before final planning
And: Risk validation results are logged for learning improvement
```

### **AC-RISK-002: Stakeholder Risk Review Triggers**
```yaml
Given: Planning phase with identified risks above medium threshold
When: Risk validation workflow detects concerning patterns
Then: Automatic escalation to user for risk review confirmation
And: User can override risk assessments with documented reasoning
And: Risk review sessions are scheduled for high-complexity scenarios
And: Stakeholder feedback improves future risk assessment accuracy
```

### **AC-RISK-003: Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Integration**
```yaml
Given: Major architectural decisions made during planning
When: Decisions involve trade-offs or risk mitigation strategies
Then: Automatic ADR generation captures decision rationale
And: ADRs include risk assessment and mitigation strategies
And: ADRs are linked to implementation epics and tasks
And: ADR review becomes part of planning validation workflow
```

### **AC-RISK-004: Feedback Loop Learning System**
```yaml
Given: Completed project with post-implementation risk analysis
When: Actual risks are compared to predicted risks from planning
Then: Risk prediction model is updated with learning data
And: Workflow patterns are refined based on accuracy metrics
And: User feedback improves risk categorization and assessment
And: Learning insights propagate to future planning sessions
```

### **AC-RISK-005: Risk Escalation Triggers**
```yaml
Given: Risk validation workflow detecting concerning patterns
When: Risk severity exceeds configurable thresholds
Then: Immediate escalation to user with specific risk details
And: Planning workflow pauses until risk acknowledgment
And: Alternative approaches are generated for high-risk scenarios
And: Risk mitigation strategies are prioritized in implementation
```

### **Risk Validation Process**
```yaml
validation_workflow:
  step_1_risk_extraction:
    process: "Extract all risk statements from planning analysis"
    validation: "Check risk against known architecture patterns"
    
  step_2_feasibility_check:
    process: "Validate risk scenarios against technical constraints"
    validation: "Verify assumptions match implementation approach"
    
  step_3_severity_assessment:
    process: "Score risk impact and probability based on validation"
    validation: "Compare to historical risk patterns and outcomes"
    
  step_4_mitigation_validation:
    process: "Verify proposed mitigations are technically feasible"
    validation: "Check mitigation strategies against resource constraints"
```

### **Integration Points**
```yaml
workflow_integration:
  planning_phase: "Real-time risk validation during architecture analysis"
  multi_perspective_validation: "Risk review across all expert lenses"
  adr_generation: "Automatic documentation of risk-related decisions"
  post_implementation: "Risk prediction accuracy feedback loops"
```
