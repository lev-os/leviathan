# Advanced Techniques Integration System

## Overview
Master specification for integrating all 8 advanced prompting techniques into a unified reasoning framework that enables technique composition and exponential capability scaling.

## Background
Each advanced technique provides unique reasoning capabilities. When integrated, they create a synergistic system where techniques enhance each other, enabling unprecedented reasoning power through MCP-based orchestration.

## Goals
- Create unified framework for all 8 techniques
- Enable seamless technique composition
- Support adaptive technique selection
- Achieve exponential scaling through combination

## Technique Integration Matrix

| Technique | Enhances | Enhanced By | Key Integration |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Chain of Thought | All techniques | Step-Back, Self-Reflection | Provides base reasoning structure |
| Tree of Thoughts | Self-Consistency, Multi-Agent | CoT, Graph of Thoughts | Enables parallel exploration |
| Graph of Thoughts | Multi-Agent, Tree of Thoughts | All techniques | Supports complex relationships |
| Self-Reflection | All techniques | Constitutional AI | Improves quality iteratively |
| Few-Shot Learning | All techniques | Self-Consistency | Provides pattern examples |
| Multi-Agent | Tree, Graph, Self-Consistency | All techniques | Distributes specialized work |
| Self-Consistency | All techniques | Tree, Multi-Agent | Validates through consensus |
| Step-Back | CoT, Tree, Graph | Few-Shot | Grounds reasoning in principles |
| Constitutional AI | All techniques | Self-Reflection | Ensures ethical compliance |

## Unified Architecture

### Technique Orchestrator
```javascript
export const techniqueOrchestrator = {
  analyze_problem_requirements: {
    description: "Determine which techniques to apply",
    parameters: {
      problem: { type: "string", required: true },
      complexity: { type: "object", required: true },
      constraints: { type: "object" }
    },
    returns: {
      recommended_techniques: ["array of technique names"],
      composition_strategy: "how to combine them",
      execution_order: "optimal sequence"
    }
  },

  compose_technique_workflow: {
    description: "Create integrated workflow from multiple techniques",
    parameters: {
      selected_techniques: { type: "array", required: true },
      problem_context: { type: "object", required: true }
    },
    returns: {
      workflow_definition: "composed workflow YAML",
      integration_points: "where techniques connect",
      memory_requirements: "unified memory structure"
    }
  }
};
```

### Integration Patterns

#### Sequential Composition
```yaml
# Example: Step-Back → CoT → Self-Reflection
sequential_flow:
  - step_back_prompting:
      extract_principles: true
      output: principles_list
  - chain_of_thought:
      input: principles_list
      guided_by_principles: true
      output: reasoning_chain
  - self_reflection:
      input: reasoning_chain
      improvement_cycles: 3
      output: refined_solution
```

#### Parallel Composition
```yaml
# Example: Multi-Agent with Tree of Thoughts per agent
parallel_flow:
  agents:
    - technical_expert:
        technique: tree_of_thoughts
        branching_factor: 3
    - business_expert:
        technique: tree_of_thoughts
        branching_factor: 3
    - validator:
        technique: self_consistency
        paths_per_validation: 5
```

#### Nested Composition
```yaml
# Example: Graph of Thoughts with CoT at each node
nested_flow:
  graph_of_thoughts:
    node_reasoning: chain_of_thought
    edge_validation: self_consistency
    node_refinement: self_reflection
```

## Behavioral Design (BDD)

```gherkin
Feature: Advanced Technique Integration
  As a user with complex reasoning needs
  I want integrated technique orchestration
  So that I get exponentially powerful reasoning

  Scenario: Automatic technique selection
    Given a complex scientific problem
    When the orchestrator analyzes requirements
    Then it recommends Step-Back for principle extraction
    And Tree of Thoughts for hypothesis exploration
    And Self-Consistency for validation
    And composes an integrated workflow

  Scenario: Synergistic technique enhancement
    Given a multi-agent reasoning task
    When each agent uses different techniques
    Then the technical agent uses Graph of Thoughts
    And the validator uses Self-Consistency
    And Constitutional AI ensures ethical compliance
    And techniques enhance each other's effectiveness
```

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Tests
```javascript

  it('should compose techniques adaptively', async () => {
    const problem = "Design a sustainable city infrastructure";
    const workflow = await orchestrator.compose_technique_workflow({
      problem,
      available_techniques: ALL_TECHNIQUES
    });
    
    expect(workflow).toInclude(['step_back', 'multi_agent', 'tree_of_thoughts']);
    expect(workflow.integration_points).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('should achieve synergistic improvements', async () => {
    const single_technique_score = await solveWithTechnique(problem, 'chain_of_thought');
    const integrated_score = await solveWithIntegration(problem, ['cot', 'self_reflection', 'self_consistency']);
    
    expect(integrated_score).toBeGreaterThan(single_technique_score * 2);
  });
});
```
