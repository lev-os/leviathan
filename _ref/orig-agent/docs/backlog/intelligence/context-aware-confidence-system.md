# ðŸŽ¯ CONTEXT-AWARE CONFIDENCE SYSTEM SPECIFICATION

*Confidence assessment that adapts based on intent type and context complexity*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Confidence scoring system that adapts thresholds and splitting behavior based on intent context
**Value**: Intelligent task decomposition that respects the nature of different types of work
**Priority**: High - Context-intelligent confidence assessment for optimal task management

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-CONFIDENCE-001: Context-Adaptive Thresholds**
```yaml
Given: Task with specific intent_type and context characteristics
When: Confidence assessment is performed
Then: Confidence thresholds adapt to intent type expectations
And: Personal experience tasks allow higher risk tolerance
And: Civilizational impact tasks require maximum confidence
And: Splitting decisions respect intent-appropriate complexity management
```

## âš¡ **ADAPTIVE CONFIDENCE THRESHOLDS**

```yaml
confidence_thresholds_by_intent:
  personal_experience:
    execution_threshold: 0.7 # Allow experimentation and learning
    split_threshold: 0.8 # Higher tolerance for uncertainty
    rationale: "Personal tasks benefit from iteration and learning"
    
  business_growth:
    execution_threshold: 0.8 # Standard business confidence
    split_threshold: 0.8 # Reliable delivery expected
    rationale: "Business tasks need reliable outcomes"
    
  organizational_coordination:
    execution_threshold: 0.85 # Higher stakes for team coordination
    split_threshold: 0.75 # Earlier splitting for complex coordination
    rationale: "Team coordination requires careful planning"
    
  civilizational_impact:
    execution_threshold: 0.9 # Maximum confidence for societal impact
    split_threshold: 0.7 # Early decomposition for complex systems
    rationale: "Societal systems require extreme reliability"
```

## ðŸ”„ **CONTEXT-AWARE SPLITTING PATTERNS**

```yaml
splitting_behavior_by_intent:
  personal_experience:
    split_pattern: "experiment â†’ evaluate â†’ iterate"
    complexity_tolerance: "high" # Personal tasks can handle uncertainty
    
  business_growth:
    split_pattern: "frontend â†’ backend â†’ testing â†’ deployment"
    complexity_tolerance: "medium" # Business tasks need systematic approach
    
  organizational_coordination:
    split_pattern: "strategy â†’ implementation â†’ change_management â†’ measurement"
    complexity_tolerance: "low" # Organizational tasks need careful planning
    
  civilizational_impact:
    split_pattern: "policy â†’ coordination â†’ implementation â†’ monitoring"
    complexity_tolerance: "very_low" # Societal tasks require extensive preparation
```

This creates confidence assessment that adapts to the nature and stakes of different types of work!
