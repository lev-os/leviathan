# Chain of Thought System

## Overview
Implementation specification for the Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning system that enables step-by-step problem solving through **bidirectional MCP calls**, giving each reasoning step FULL LLM power instead of diluted 1/20th attention.

## Background
Traditional CoT prompting forces the LLM to simulate all reasoning steps internally within a single context, dramatically reducing reasoning power per step. Our revolutionary approach uses **bidirectional MCP calls** where:
- LLM plans the reasoning workflow (20 steps)
- Each step gets its own MCP call with FULL model capacity
- Results flow back to inform next steps
- **20x more reasoning power** compared to single-call CoT

## Goals
- Implement robust CoT workflow system with MCP tool integration
- Enable 10x+ reasoning power scaling through discrete step execution
- Provide transparent reasoning traces for auditability
- Support dynamic step generation based on problem complexity

## Non-Goals
- Not replacing existing simple reasoning for basic tasks
- Not enforcing CoT for all interactions (opt-in based on complexity)
- Not handling real-time reasoning requirements (designed for thoroughness)

## Detailed Design

    },
    handler: async (params) => {
      // Generate focused reasoning for next step
      const step = await generateStep(params);
      return {
        step_number: params.previous_steps.length + 1,
        reasoning: step.content,

      problem_statement: { type: "string", required: true }
    },
    handler: async (params) => {
      // Check each step follows logically and addresses problem
      const validation = await validateChain(params);
      return {
        is_valid: validation.valid,
        consistency_score: validation.score,
