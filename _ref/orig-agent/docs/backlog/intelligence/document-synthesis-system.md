And: Chapter-level synthesis combined into book-level insights
And: Cross-chapter themes and connections identified
And: Top 10 insights extracted without losing critical content
```

### **AC-DOCSYNC-006: Research Paper Specialization**
```yaml
Given: Academic or research document requiring specialized analysis
When: Research paper analysis mode is detected
Then: Abstract analysis extracts research claims and methodology
And: Results synthesis identifies key findings and statistical significance
And: Methodology evaluation assesses research quality and limitations
And: Implications analysis determines actionable insights and applications
And: Citation and reference analysis builds knowledge connections
```

### **AC-DOCSYNC-007: CEO Strategic Integration**
```yaml
Given: CEO agent requiring document analysis for strategic planning
When: Document synthesis workflow integrates with CEO strategist endpoint
Then: Auto-triggers activate for documents > 5,000 words
And: Strategic focus areas (market trends, competitive analysis) prioritized
And: Results formatted for strategic decision-making
And: Synthesis results can feed into multi-perspective validation workflow
And: Combined analysis produces comprehensive strategic recommendations
```

  context_window: 500     # additional context words for continuity
  
adaptive_sizing:
  high_density_content: "reduce_shard_size by 30%"  # Dense technical content
  medium_density_content: "standard_shard_size"     # Normal prose
