# Multi-Agent Reasoning System

## Overview
Implementation specification for collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning where specialized AI agents work together through **bidirectional MCP orchestration**, giving each agent FULL model capacity for their specialized domain.

## Background
Traditional multi-agent simulation forces a single LLM to role-play all agents internally, diluting expertise. Our approach uses **bidirectional MCP architecture** where:
- Orchestrator plans agent collaboration (e.g., 5 specialists)
- Each agent gets dedicated MCP calls with FULL reasoning power
- Agent outputs flow back for coordination and synthesis
- **5x-10x more specialized reasoning** than simulated agents

## Goals
- Implement specialized agent collaboration framework
- Enable structured inter-agent communication
- Support consensus building and conflict resolution
- Scale to 8x+ reasoning power through agent specialization

## Detailed Design

### MCP Tool Implementation
```javascript
export const multiAgentTools = {
  setup_multi_agent_workspace: {
    parameters: {
      problem_statement: { type: "string", required: true },
      required_expertise: { type: "array", required: true }
    }
  },

  orchestrator_task_breakdown: {
    parameters: {
      problem_statement: { type: "string", required: true },
      available_agents: { type: "object", required: true }
    }
  },

  process_agent_subtask: {
    parameters: {
      agent_role: { type: "string", required: true },
      subtask: { type: "object", required: true }
    }
  },

  orchestrator_conflict_resolution: {
    parameters: {
      conflicts: { type: "array", required: true },
      resolution_strategy: { type: "string", required: true }
    }
  }
};
```

### Agent Role Definitions
```yaml
agent_roles:
  orchestrator:
    capabilities: ["task_decomposition", "workflow_management"]
    authority_level: "high"
  
  domain_expert:
    capabilities: ["specialized_analysis", "domain_validation"]
    authority_level: "domain_specific"
  
  validator:
    capabilities: ["solution_validation", "consistency_checking"]
    authority_level: "medium"
```

## Behavioral Design (BDD)
```gherkin
Feature: Multi-Agent Collaboration
  As a user with complex multi-faceted problems
  I want specialized agents working together
  So that each aspect gets expert attention

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-MAR-001: Dedicated Agent MCP Calls**
```yaml
Given: Problem requiring 5 specialized agents (tech, legal, UX, business, security)
When: Multi-agent collaboration is orchestrated
Then: Each agent gets dedicated MCP calls for their domain
And: Each agent operates at FULL model capacity
And: No role-playing dilution occurs
```

### **AC-MAR-002: Bidirectional Coordination**
```yaml
Given: Agents producing specialized outputs
When: Coordination phase is triggered
Then: Agent outputs flow back via MCP to orchestrator
And: Orchestrator synthesizes findings with new MCP call
And: Conflicts resolved through targeted agent queries
```

### **AC-MAR-003: Dynamic Agent Spawning**
```yaml
Given: Problem revealing need for additional expertise
When: Gap in knowledge coverage detected
Then: Orchestrator can spawn new specialist agents
And: New agents receive full context via MCP
And: Total reasoning scales with agent count
```
