# ðŸ’¡ CONTEXT CAPTURE AUTOMATION SPECIFICATION

*LLM-driven recognition of context capture opportunities and workflow triggers*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Automate "aha moments" where LLM recognizes opportunities for context capture, task creation, and workflow activation
**Value**: Proactive system that suggests valuable actions based on conversation analysis
**Priority**: High - Core intelligence enhancement for workflow automation

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-CONTEXT-001: Conversation Analysis Recognition**
```yaml
Given: Ongoing conversation with significant decisions or insights
When: LLM analyzes conversation flow and content
Then: LLM recognizes patterns that indicate context capture opportunities
And: LLM identifies actionable insights that should be preserved
And: LLM detects when discussion has reached logical capture points
And: Recognition uses LLM native intelligence, not pattern matching
```

### **AC-CONTEXT-002: Workflow Trigger Suggestions**
```yaml
Given: LLM recognizes context capture opportunity
When: LLM evaluates available workflow options
Then: LLM suggests appropriate workflows (task creation, PRD generation, feature capture)
And: LLM provides reasoning for workflow recommendation
And: LLM offers multiple organization options when applicable
And: Suggestions are contextual and relevant to current discussion
```

### **AC-CONTEXT-003: Save All This Pattern Recognition**
```yaml
Given: User intimates desire to capture discussion ("save this", "let's document this", "create tasks from this")
When: LLM processes capture intent
Then: LLM recognizes this as workflow trigger for context capture
And: LLM analyzes conversation for task/PRD extraction opportunities
And: LLM activates appropriate capture workflow based on content type
And: LLM handles implicit capture requests without requiring exact phrases
```

### **AC-CONTEXT-004: Periodic Context Validation**
```yaml
Given: Extended conversation or complex discussion
When: Plugin system provides periodic validation prompts
Then: LLM performs context awareness checks and workflow opportunity assessment
And: LLM validates current understanding and system prompt alignment
And: LLM identifies opportunities for proactive task organization
And: LLM suggests workflow activations when beneficial
```## ðŸ§  **AUTOMATION INTELLIGENCE PATTERNS**

### **Context Capture Opportunity Recognition**
```yaml
recognition_patterns:
  decision_capture: "Key architectural or business decisions made"
  insight_synthesis: "Multiple related concepts discussed and resolved"
  implementation_planning: "Technical approach clarified with concrete steps"
  feature_evolution: "New capabilities or improvements identified"
  workflow_completion: "Discussion reaches natural completion point"

llm_analysis_framework:
  conversation_assessment: |
    "Has this discussion produced actionable insights or decisions?"
    "Are there implementation tasks that could be organized?"
    "Would future sessions benefit from structured capture of this content?"
    "Is this discussion at a natural capture/transition point?"
    
  workflow_selection: |
    "Does this need task breakdown (development workflow)?"
    "Does this need feature documentation (PRD workflow)?"
    "Does this need decision recording (architecture workflow)?"
    "Does this need context preservation (discussion capture workflow)?"
```

### **Save All This Workflow Activation**
```yaml
capture_intent_recognition:
  explicit_phrases: ["save all this", "capture this discussion", "create tasks from this"]
  implicit_signals: ["let's document this", "we should organize this", "this needs to be saved"]
  context_indicators: ["complex discussion completion", "multiple decisions made", "implementation clarity achieved"]

workflow_mapping:
  task_creation: "Discussion contains actionable implementation work"
  prd_generation: "Discussion contains feature requirements and business logic" 
  decision_documentation: "Discussion contains architectural or strategic decisions"
  context_preservation: "Discussion contains valuable insights for future reference"
```

### **Proactive Workflow Suggestions**
```yaml
suggestion_triggers:
  natural_breakpoints: "Discussion reaches logical conclusion or transition"
  complexity_threshold: "Conversation contains multiple interconnected concepts"
  decision_density: "High frequency of decisions or choices made"
  implementation_clarity: "Technical approach becomes clear and actionable"

suggestion_patterns:
  task_organization: "This discussion could be organized into X actionable tasks"
  feature_documentation: "This feature concept could be captured as a PRD"
  decision_recording: "These architectural decisions should be documented"
  workflow_activation: "This content fits the [workflow_name] pattern"
```

## ðŸ”Œ **PLUGIN INTEGRATION**

### **Context Awareness Plugin**
```javascript
// Plugin provides hints, LLM makes intelligent decisions
const contextAwarenessPlugin = {
  name: 'context-awareness',
  always: async (context) => {
    // Simple hint injection, no decision logic
    context.result.agentInstructions += `
    
ðŸ’¡ CONTEXT AWARENESS CHECK:
Consider if this conversation has produced:
- Key decisions that should be captured
- Actionable tasks that could be organized  
- Insights that would benefit from structured preservation
- Workflow activation opportunities

You can suggest context capture, task creation, or workflow triggers when beneficial.`;
  }
};
```

### **Workflow Trigger Integration**
```yaml
workflow_trigger_system:
  recognition_engine: "LLM analyzes conversation for workflow opportunities"
  suggestion_mechanism: "LLM proactively suggests relevant workflows"
  activation_process: "LLM triggers workflows based on content analysis"
  
workflow_mapping:
  "save_all_this" â†’ task_creation_workflow
  "document_decisions" â†’ architecture_decision_workflow  
  "organize_discussion" â†’ prd_generation_workflow
  "capture_insights" â†’ context_preservation_workflow
```

## ðŸ’¡ **IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES**

### **LLM-First Intelligence**
- **LLM Recognition**: All pattern recognition and opportunity assessment
- **LLM Decision**: All workflow selection and trigger decisions
- **Plugin Role**: Provide awareness hints and context, no decision logic
- **Natural Processing**: Handle implicit capture requests through understanding

### **Workflow Integration Philosophy**
- **Everything is Workflow**: Context capture, task creation, PRD generation all follow workflow patterns
- **Plugin Mapping**: Plugins provide context clues that map to workflow files
- **Trigger Flexibility**: Multiple ways to activate same underlying workflows
- **Context Preservation**: All capture maintains full conversational context

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING APPROACH**

**Unit Tests**: Context recognition patterns, workflow suggestion logic
**Integration Tests**: Plugin hint injection, workflow trigger activation
**E2E Tests**: Complete context capture from recognition through task creation
