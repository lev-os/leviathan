# ðŸ“‹ ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORD (ADR) SYSTEM SPECIFICATION

*Automated capture and tracking of architectural decisions with rationale and trade-offs*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Systematic capture of architectural decisions during planning with rationale, alternatives, and consequences
**Value**: Preserve decision context for future reference, enable informed architecture evolution, reduce repeated debates
**Priority**: High - Essential for maintaining architectural coherence and knowledge preservation

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-ADR-001: Automatic ADR Generation During Planning**
```yaml
Given: CEO agent making significant architectural decisions during planning
When: Decision involves technology choices, integration patterns, or design trade-offs
Then: ADR is automatically generated with decision context and rationale
And: Multiple alternatives are documented with pros/cons analysis
And: Consequences and risks are captured for future reference
And: ADR is linked to relevant epics and implementation tasks
```

### **AC-ADR-002: Decision Context Capture**
```yaml
Given: Architectural decision being made with available context
When: ADR generation workflow is triggered
Then: Decision context includes business requirements and constraints
And: Technical constraints and requirements are documented
And: Stakeholder perspectives and concerns are captured
And: Timeline and resource constraints are included in context
And: Related decisions and dependencies are cross-referenced
```

### **AC-ADR-003: Alternative Analysis Framework**
```yaml
Given: Architectural decision with multiple possible approaches
When: ADR analysis evaluates alternatives
Then: Each alternative is assessed for technical feasibility
And: Business impact and strategic alignment are evaluated
And: Resource requirements and timeline implications are documented
And: Risk assessment is performed for each alternative
And: Recommendation rationale clearly explains selection criteria
```

### **AC-ADR-004: Decision Tracking and Evolution**
```yaml
Given: ADR documented during planning phase
When: Implementation proceeds and new information emerges
Then: ADR status is tracked (proposed â†’ accepted â†’ implemented â†’ superseded)
And: Implementation outcomes are compared to predicted consequences
And: ADR updates capture lessons learned and actual results
And: Related ADRs are automatically linked and cross-referenced
And: Decision impact assessment guides future similar decisions
```

### **AC-ADR-005: Integration with Planning Workflows**
```yaml
Given: Multi-perspective validation and document synthesis workflows
When: Architectural decisions emerge from analysis
Then: ADR generation is triggered automatically by workflow
And: Expert perspective insights are incorporated into ADR content
And: Document synthesis provides context for decision background
And: Risk validation workflow ensures ADR accuracy and completeness
And: ADRs become input for subsequent planning and implementation
```
