# Self-Reflection System

## Overview
Implementation specification for Self-Reflection reasoning using **bidirectional MCP architecture** where each reflection cycle gets FULL model capacity for deep critique and refinement.

## Background
Traditional self-reflection shares attention between output and critique. Our approach uses **bidirectional MCP calls** where:
- Initial output generation gets dedicated MCP call
- Each reflection cycle uses separate full-power reasoning
- Refinements apply focused improvements per cycle
- **5x-10x deeper** reflection through dedicated compute
Research shows 75.8% reduction in toxicity and 77% reduction in bias.

## Goals
- Implement iterative critique-improve cycles via MCP
- Enable configurable reflection criteria and depth
- Reduce errors and bias through systematic self-evaluation
- Scale reflection power through dedicated MCP calls per cycle

## Detailed Design

### MCP Tool Implementation
```javascript
export const selfReflectionTools = {
  generate_initial_response: {
    description: "Create initial response to user query",
    parameters: {
      user_query: { type: "string", required: true },
      generation_guidelines: { type: "string" }
    }
  },

  perform_self_critique: {
    description: "Critically analyze response for improvements",
    parameters: {
      target_response: { type: "string", required: true },
      critique_criteria: { type: "array", required: true }
    }
  },

  refine_response_based_on_critique: {
    description: "Improve response addressing identified issues",
    parameters: {
      original_response: { type: "string", required: true },
      critique_feedback: { type: "object", required: true }
    }
  }
};
```

### Workflow Configuration
```yaml
name: self_reflection_improvement
version: "1.0"

parameters:
  max_iterations: 5
  improvement_threshold: 0.1
  quality_threshold: 0.9
  critique_criteria: ["accuracy", "completeness", "bias_detection", "clarity"]
```

## Behavioral Design (BDD)
```gherkin
Feature: Self-Reflection Improvement
  As a user seeking high-quality AI responses
  I want iterative self-critique and refinement
  So that outputs are accurate, unbiased, and comprehensive

  Scenario: Iterative response improvement
    Given an initial AI response with potential issues
    When self-reflection cycles are applied
    Then the system should identify specific flaws
    And generate improved versions addressing critiques
    And continue until quality threshold is met
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-SRF-001: Dedicated Reflection Cycles**
```yaml
Given: Initial output requiring quality improvement
When: Self-reflection process is initiated
Then: Each reflection cycle gets dedicated MCP call
And: Critique has full model reasoning capacity
And: Refinements based on focused analysis
```

### **AC-SRF-002: Multi-Criteria Evaluation**
```yaml
Given: Output to evaluate across multiple quality dimensions
When: Reflection criteria are applied
Then: Each criterion evaluated with separate attention
And: Improvements targeted to specific weaknesses
And: Quality metrics tracked across iterations
```

### **AC-SRF-003: Convergence Detection**
```yaml
Given: Multiple reflection cycles completed
When: Quality improvements plateau
Then: System detects convergence via MCP analysis
And: Reflection terminates at optimal point
And: Final output represents best achievable quality
```
