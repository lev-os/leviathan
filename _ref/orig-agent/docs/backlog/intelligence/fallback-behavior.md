# ðŸ¤” FALLBACK BEHAVIOR SPECIFICATION

*When system is uncertain, explain reasoning and let user choose*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Handle uncertainty gracefully by showing reasoning and offering user choices
**Value**: Better user experience when system is confused, maintains transparency
**Priority**: Medium - Quality of life improvement

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-FALLBACK-001: Uncertainty Detection**
```yaml
Given: System receives ambiguous user request
When: Confidence in routing decision is low (<0.6)
Then: System recognizes uncertainty
And: System explains its reasoning
And: System offers multiple numbered options for user to choose
```

### **AC-FALLBACK-002: Reasoning Explanation**
```yaml
Given: System is uncertain about request
When: Presenting options to user
Then: System explains what it analyzed
And: System shows why it's uncertain
And: System describes each option's implications
```

### **AC-FALLBACK-003: User Choice Interface**
```yaml
Given: System presents fallback options
When: User sees the options
Then: Options are numbered for easy selection
And: Each option has clear description
And: User can type number to select
And: "Let me choose" option is always available
```

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING APPROACH**

**Unit Tests**: Uncertainty detection logic, option generation
**Integration Tests**: Complete fallback workflow, user choice handling
**E2E Tests**: Ambiguous requests with successful resolution

## ðŸ’¡ **EXAMPLE SCENARIOS**

### **Scenario 1: Technical vs Design Ambiguity**
```
User: "Fix the payment page"
System: "I'm unsure whether this is a design or technical task.
My reasoning: Contains both UI elements and API changes.
What's your priority:
1. Focus on visual design first
2. Handle backend logic first  
3. Let me choose the approach"
```

### **Scenario 2: Multiple Valid Interpretations**
```
User: "Set up authentication"
System: "I see multiple approaches for authentication.
My reasoning: Could be user login, API auth, or admin access.
What type do you need:
1. User login system (registration, passwords, sessions)
2. API authentication (tokens, rate limiting)
3. Admin access control (roles, permissions)
4. Let me choose based on your project context"
```

### **Scenario 3: Insufficient Context**
```
User: "Make it faster"
System: "I need more context to help with performance.
My reasoning: 'Faster' could apply to many aspects.
What needs optimization:
1. Page load speed (frontend performance)
2. Database queries (backend optimization)
3. Build process (development workflow)
4. Let me analyze your project and suggest priorities"
