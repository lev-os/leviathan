# ðŸ”„ FLEXIBLE WORKFLOWS SPECIFICATION

*Pure flexibility with smart hints - workflows as guidance, not rigid rules*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Workflow templates provide intelligent suggestions while preserving LLM flexibility
**Value**: Context-aware workflow guidance without constraining natural agent behavior
**Priority**: Medium - Enhanced user experience and workflow optimization

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-WORKFLOW-001: Flexible Workflow Templates**
```yaml
Given: A workflow template exists for a goal type
When: User initiates work on that goal
Then: System provides workflow suggestions as hints
And: LLM can adapt or ignore suggestions based on context
And: Workflow includes multiple valid paths (research_first vs write_first)
And: All suggestions include time estimates and agent assignments
```

### **AC-WORKFLOW-002: Smart Hints Display**
```yaml
Given: A workflow template with multiple paths
When: System displays workflow options
Then: 3-4 smart next step options are shown
And: Auto mode option is always included
And: Time estimates are provided for each option
And: Gentle pushback suggestions appear when something seems off
And: Context determines which path is emphasized
```

### **AC-WORKFLOW-003: Context-Aware Adaptation**
```yaml
Given: A workflow template and current project context
When: Displaying workflow suggestions
Then: LLM adapts suggestions based on project state
And: Previous progress influences next step recommendations
And: Agent availability affects workflow path selection
And: User preferences override template defaults
```### **AC-WORKFLOW-004: Template Structure**
```yaml
Given: A workflow template definition
When: Loading workflow configuration
Then: Template contains goal, agents, multiple step paths
And: Display strategy includes hint patterns and auto mode
And: Template supports dynamic agent substitution
And: Workflow patterns are suggestions, not requirements
```

## ðŸ”„ **WORKFLOW TEMPLATE STRUCTURE**

### **Example Template**
```yaml
# workflows/content-creation.yaml
metadata:
  id: "content-creation"
  name: "Content Creation Workflow"
  goal: "Create content (blog, article, documentation)"

agents:
  - researcher: {capabilities: [gather_info, verify_facts]}
  - writer: {capabilities: [outline, draft, edit]}
  - designer: {capabilities: [visuals, layout]}
  - fact_checker: {capabilities: [verify, validate]}
  - editor: {capabilities: [polish, review]}

workflow_paths:
  research_first:
    name: "Research-Driven Approach"
    sequence: [researcher, writer, fact_checker, editor]
    best_for: ["complex topics", "unfamiliar domains", "fact-heavy content"]
    
  write_first:
    name: "Draft-First Approach"  
    sequence: [writer, researcher, fact_checker, editor]
    best_for: ["familiar topics", "opinion pieces", "time pressure"]
    
  design_led:
    name: "Visual-First Approach"
    sequence: [designer, writer, researcher, editor]
    best_for: ["visual content", "infographics", "presentation materials"]

display_strategy: |
  Context-aware display rules:
  - Always include 3-4 smart next step options
  - Include auto mode: "Let me handle the full sequence"
  - Provide time estimates: "(researcher, 30min)"
  - Gentle pushback: "This seems like it might need research first"
  - Adapt based on project state and previous work
```

## ðŸŽ® **SMART HINTS PATTERNS**

### **Hint Generation Rules**
```yaml
smart_hints:
  time_estimates:
    - "Quick task (15min)"
    - "Focused session (45min)" 
    - "Deep work (2+ hours)"
    
  gentle_pushback:
    - "This might benefit from research first"
    - "Consider breaking this into smaller pieces"
    - "You might want to validate assumptions"
    
  auto_mode_options:
    - "Auto Mode - Let me handle full sequence"
    - "Guided Mode - I'll suggest each step"
    - "Manual Mode - You choose each step"
    
  context_adaptations:
    - Previous step completion affects next suggestions
    - Agent availability influences path recommendations
    - Project complexity modifies time estimates
    - User preferences override default patterns
```

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING APPROACH**

**Unit Tests**: Template loading, hint generation, context adaptation rules
**Integration Tests**: Workflow suggestion display, agent routing integration
**E2E Tests**: Complete workflow execution with flexible path changes

## ðŸ’¡ **IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS**

### **Workflow as Hints, Not Rules**
- Templates provide suggestions, LLM makes final decisions
- Context overrides template recommendations
- User can deviate from workflow at any time
- System learns from successful deviations

### **Dynamic Adaptation**
- Workflow suggestions change based on project progress
- Agent availability affects path recommendations  
- Time constraints influence workflow path selection
- Quality requirements modify agent sequence
