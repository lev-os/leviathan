# ðŸ”„ INTENT-ADAPTIVE WORKFLOWS SPECIFICATION

*Workflow templates that adapt based on intent type and context cascade*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Workflow system that automatically adapts execution patterns based on intent classification
**Value**: Optimal workflow selection from personal task management to civilizational coordination
**Priority**: High - Intelligent workflow adaptation with intent awareness

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-WORKFLOW-001: Intent-Driven Workflow Selection**
```yaml
Given: Task with classified intent_type and complexity assessment
When: Workflow selection is performed
Then: Workflow template matches intent characteristics
And: Workflow steps adapt to intent scale and coordination requirements
And: Same workflow templates scale across personal to civilizational contexts
And: Workflow coordination patterns match intent type behavior expectations
```

## ðŸŒŠ **ADAPTIVE WORKFLOW TEMPLATES**

```yaml
workflow_templates_by_intent:
  personal_experience:
    template: "research â†’ plan â†’ execute â†’ reflect"
    coordination: "sequential_with_personal_feedback"
    decision_points: ["preference_validation", "resource_check", "satisfaction_assessment"]
    
  business_growth:
    template: "analyze â†’ design â†’ build â†’ test â†’ deploy"
    coordination: "parallel_development_with_integration"
    decision_points: ["business_validation", "technical_feasibility", "market_readiness"]
    
  organizational_coordination:
    template: "strategize â†’ plan â†’ implement â†’ adopt â†’ optimize"
    coordination: "phased_rollout_with_stakeholder_engagement"
    decision_points: ["stakeholder_alignment", "change_readiness", "success_measurement"]
    
  civilizational_impact:
    template: "policy_design â†’ multi_stakeholder_coordination â†’ implementation â†’ monitoring"
    coordination: "distributed_consensus_with_governance_oversight"
    decision_points: ["democratic_validation", "coordination_agreement", "impact_assessment"]
```

## âš¡ **CONTEXT-AWARE ADAPTATION**

```yaml
adaptation_rules:
  workflow_complexity_scaling:
    low_complexity: "Compress workflow steps, minimize overhead"
    medium_complexity: "Standard workflow with validation points"
    high_complexity: "Expand workflow with extensive coordination"
    
  context_inheritance_integration:
    parent_context_workflows: "Inherit coordination patterns from parent"
    context_adaptations: "Modify workflow steps based on specific requirements"
    cross_context_coordination: "Add workflow steps for dependency management"
```

This creates workflows that intelligently adapt to the nature and scale of what we're trying to achieve!
