# ðŸ”ª INTENT-DRIVEN SPLITTING & PIVOTING SPECIFICATION

*Task decomposition and pivot management using intent-context architecture*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Task splitting and pivoting system that preserves intent while adapting implementation based on context cascade inheritance
**Value**: Intelligent decomposition that maintains business goals across complexity changes and strategic pivots
**Priority**: High - Core workflow management with intent preservation

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-SPLIT-001: Confidence-Based Context Decomposition**
```yaml
Given: A task with complexity > 0.8 (confidence < 8) 
When: Task splitting is triggered
Then: Original intent is preserved across all sub-contexts
And: Each sub-context inherits from parent business goal with specific adaptations
And: Sub-contexts maintain dependency relationships toward original intent fulfillment
And: Each sub-context is re-analyzed for appropriate routing (one-shot to project structure)
```

### **AC-SPLIT-002: Intent-Type Aware Splitting Patterns**
```yaml
Given: Task requiring decomposition with specific intent_type
When: System determines splitting approach
Then: Splitting pattern matches intent_type characteristics
And: Personal_experience splits into [planning, execution, follow-up]
And: Business_growth splits into [frontend, backend, testing, deployment] 
And: Organizational_coordination splits into [strategy, implementation, change_management, measurement]
And: Civilizational_impact splits into [policy, implementation, coordination, monitoring]
```

### **AC-PIVOT-001: Intent vs Implementation Pivot Classification**
```yaml
Given: Need to change project direction or approach
When: Pivot analysis is performed
Then: System distinguishes between intent-level and implementation-level pivots
And: Implementation pivots preserve business goal and intent_type
And: Intent evolution pivots change fundamental business goal and may change intent_type
And: Pivot propagation through context cascade is intelligently managed
And: Dependencies are updated to reflect new implementation or intent reality
```

### **AC-PIVOT-002: Smart Context Impact Analysis**
```yaml
Given: Pivot affecting parent context with child contexts
When: Pivot impact analysis is performed  
Then: Child contexts are classified as preserve, transform, or archive
And: Preserved contexts maintain business goal with updated adaptations
And: Transformed contexts get new adaptations for changed intent
And: Archived contexts are cleanly removed with dependency cleanup
And: New contexts are created if pivot requires additional implementation areas
```

## ðŸ”ª **CONFIDENCE-BASED SPLITTING SYSTEM**

### **Split Trigger Analysis**
```yaml
split_triggers:
  confidence_threshold: 0.8 # If confidence < 8, split required
  complexity_factors:
    - scope: "How many systems/people affected?"
    - uncertainty: "How many unknowns exist?"
    - dependencies: "How many external factors?"
    - implementation_paths: "How many different approaches possible?"
    
split_decision_logic:
  if complexity_score > 0.8:
    action: mandatory_split
    reason: "Exceeds manageable complexity threshold"
  elif complexity_score > 0.6 AND has_natural_boundaries:
    action: recommended_split  
    reason: "Would benefit from decomposition"
  else:
    action: keep_unified
    reason: "Manageable as single task"
```

### **Intent Preservation Protocol**
```yaml
intent_preservation:
  core_principle: "Business goal never changes during splitting"
  
  preservation_process:
    1. extract_original_intent: "What are we fundamentally trying to achieve?"
    2. identify_implementation_boundaries: "Where can we naturally divide the work?"
    3. create_sub_contexts: "Each inherits intent, gets specific adaptation"
    4. maintain_inheritance_chain: "All sub-contexts extend from parent business goal"
    5. establish_coordination_dependencies: "Sub-contexts must coordinate toward intent"
    
  validation_check: "Can we achieve original intent if all sub-contexts succeed?"
```

### **Context Decomposition Examples**

#### **Business Growth Intent Splitting**
```yaml
# Original complex task
original_task:
  intent: "Users need secure authentication for e-commerce platform"
  intent_type: business_growth
  context: client-abc/auth-ecommerce/
  complexity: 0.85
  confidence: 7.5 # Below threshold
  
# Intelligent decomposition
decomposition_result:
  parent_context: client-abc/auth-ecommerce/
  business_goal: "Users need secure authentication for e-commerce platform" # Preserved
  
  sub_contexts:
    auth-frontend/:
      intent: "Users need secure authentication for e-commerce platform" # Same
      context_adaptation: "React login/signup forms with validation"
      implementation_scope: "Client-side authentication UI"
      complexity: 0.6
      confidence: 8.2 # Now manageable
      routing: project_structure
      
    auth-backend/:
      intent: "Users need secure authentication for e-commerce platform" # Same  
      context_adaptation: "JWT service with database integration"
      implementation_scope: "Server-side authentication logic"
      complexity: 0.7
      confidence: 8.0 # Now manageable
      routing: project_structure
      
    auth-security/:
      intent: "Users need secure authentication for e-commerce platform" # Same
      context_adaptation: "Security testing and penetration testing"
      implementation_scope: "Authentication security validation"
      complexity: 0.5
      confidence: 8.5 # Now manageable
      routing: mini_workflow
      
  coordination_dependencies:
    - auth-backend blocks auth-frontend (API must exist first)
    - auth-security depends_on [auth-frontend, auth-backend] (test complete system)
```

#### **Personal Experience Intent Splitting**
```yaml
# Personal scale example
original_task:
  intent: "Create memorable anniversary celebration"
  intent_type: personal_experience
  complexity: 0.8 # Multiple unknowns and coordination needed
  
decomposition_result:
  planning/:
    intent: "Create memorable anniversary celebration" # Same
    context_adaptation: "Research venues, activities, and logistics"
    complexity: 0.4
    routing: mini_workflow
    
  execution/:
    intent: "Create memorable anniversary celebration" # Same
    context_adaptation: "Execute planned celebration activities"
    complexity: 0.5  
    routing: one_shot # Simple execution once planned
    
  follow_up/:
    intent: "Create memorable anniversary celebration" # Same
    context_adaptation: "Capture memories and plan future celebrations"
    complexity: 0.3
    routing: one_shot # Simple documentation
```

```

## âš¡ **DYNAMIC COMPRESSION INTEGRATION**

### **Post-Split Re-routing**
```yaml
post_split_routing:
  principle: "Each sub-context gets fresh complexity analysis and routing decision"
  
  re_analysis_process:
    1. calculate_new_complexity: "Assess sub-context complexity independently"
    2. maintain_intent_type: "Inherit from parent context"
    3. determine_new_routing: "Apply dynamic compression to sub-context"
    4. coordinate_execution: "Ensure sub-contexts work toward parent intent"
    
  routing_possibilities:
    - parent: project_structure â†’ child: mini_workflow (simplified through splitting)
    - parent: multi_project â†’ child: project_structure (decomposed to manageable projects)
    - parent: multi_workspace â†’ child: project_structure (distributed across workspaces)
```

### **Pivot-Triggered Re-compression**
```yaml
pivot_recompression:
  trigger: "Intent_type or complexity changes due to pivot"
  
  recompression_analysis:
    old_intent_type: "Original intent classification"
    new_intent_type: "Post-pivot intent classification"
    complexity_delta: "Change in implementation complexity"
    stakeholder_delta: "Change in coordination requirements"
    
  routing_adjustments:
    personal_experience â†’ business_growth: "Upgrade to project structure"
    business_growth â†’ organizational_coordination: "Upgrade to multi-project coordination"
    implementation_pivot_same_type: "Maintain routing level, update implementation approach"
```

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING APPROACH**

**Unit Tests**: Split trigger logic, intent preservation validation, pivot classification accuracy
**Integration Tests**: Context decomposition with dependency management, pivot impact analysis with context updates
**E2E Tests**: Complete split-to-execution cycle, full pivot transformation with coordination
**Pattern Tests**: Intent-type specific splitting behaviors, pivot resilience across different scales

## ðŸ’¡ **IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES**

### **Intent-First Philosophy**
- **Business Goal Preservation**: Splitting never changes what we're trying to achieve
- **Context Inheritance**: All sub-contexts inherit and extend parent business goals
- **Smart Decomposition**: Natural boundaries determined by intent_type and implementation reality
- **Coordination Toward Intent**: Dependencies ensure sub-contexts work together toward original goal

### **Intelligent Adaptation**
- **Context-Aware Pivoting**: Pivot impact varies by intent_type and implementation boundaries
- **Preservation vs Transformation**: Smart classification of what can be kept vs what must change
- **Dynamic Re-routing**: Complexity changes trigger fresh routing decisions for optimal execution
