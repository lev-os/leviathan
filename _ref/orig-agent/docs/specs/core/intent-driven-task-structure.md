# ðŸ“‹ INTENT-DRIVEN TASK STRUCTURE SPECIFICATION

*Task system rooted in intent-context architecture with universal scaling patterns*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Task structure that inherits from intent-context cascade and scales from personal tasks to planetary coordination
**Value**: Universal task format that preserves business goals while adapting implementation across any complexity scale
**Priority**: High - Foundational task management with intent preservation and context inheritance

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-TASK-001: Intent-Rooted Task Creation**
```yaml
Given: Human intent requires implementation through tasks
When: Task is created from intent-context cascade
Then: Task inherits business goal from parent context
And: Task includes intent_source reference and intent_type classification
And: Task context_adaptations specify how this task differs from universal business goal
And: Task maintains dual-file structure (YAML metadata + MD implementation context)
```

### **AC-TASK-002: Context Cascade Integration**
```yaml
Given: Task exists within context hierarchy
When: Accessing task metadata and implementation details
Then: Task YAML references parent context and inheritance chain
And: Task includes context_adaptations explaining implementation-specific requirements
And: Task dependencies can reference contexts across workspace boundaries
And: Task routing (one-shot to multi-project) determined by intent_type and complexity
```

### **AC-TASK-003: Intent Preservation Through Changes**
```yaml
Given: Task undergoes splitting, pivoting, or evolution
When: Task structure is modified
Then: Original intent and business goal are preserved
And: Context inheritance chain is maintained and updated appropriately
And: Intent-type classification drives splitting patterns and pivot impact analysis
And: Implementation context (MD) captures full reasoning and decision history
```

### **AC-TASK-004: Universal Scaling Patterns**
```yaml
Given: Tasks exist across different intent_types and complexity scales
When: Managing tasks from personal to civilizational scale
Then: Same task structure handles "plan dinner" and "reform tax system"
And: Intent_type determines appropriate task coordination patterns
And: Context cascade enables business goal reuse across implementation boundaries
And: Task relationships preserve business logic while enabling technical flexibility
```

### **Context Inheritance Examples**

#### **Business Growth: Authentication Across Contexts**
```yaml
# Universal business goal context
contexts/user-authentication/:
  business_goal: "Secure user authentication"
  intent_type: business_growth
  
# Specific implementation contexts inherit and adapt
tasks/client-abc-auth-ecommerce.yaml:
  intent_context:
    business_goal: "Secure user authentication" # Inherited
    context_adaptations: "E-commerce payment integration, PCI compliance, social login"
    
tasks/client-def-auth-mobile.yaml:
  intent_context:
    business_goal: "Secure user authentication" # Same inheritance
    context_adaptations: "Mobile biometric integration, offline capability, app store compliance"

# Cross-workspace reference
tasks/government-auth-citizens.yaml:
  intent_context:
    business_goal: "Secure user authentication" # Same universal goal
    context_adaptations: "National ID integration, privacy compliance, multi-language support"
  context_inheritance:
    parent_context: "government-services/citizen-portal/"
    extends: "contexts/user-authentication/" # Cross-workspace inheritance
```

#### **Personal Experience: Planning Across Scales**
```yaml
# Universal experience goal
contexts/memorable-experiences/:
  business_goal: "Create meaningful, memorable experiences"
  intent_type: personal_experience
  
# Personal scale
tasks/anniversary-dinner.yaml:
  intent_context:
    business_goal: "Create meaningful, memorable experiences" # Inherited
    context_adaptations: "Romantic dinner for two, special anniversary, intimate setting"
    
# Social scale  
tasks/wedding-celebration.yaml:
  intent_context:
    business_goal: "Create meaningful, memorable experiences" # Same goal
    context_adaptations: "Large celebration, family coordination, cultural traditions"
```

## âš¡ **DYNAMIC ROUTING INTEGRATION**

### **Intent-Driven Task Routing**
```yaml
routing_analysis:
  factors:
    intent_type: "Primary routing driver"
    complexity: "Technical and coordination complexity"
    scope: "Number of people/systems affected"
    urgency: "Timeline requirements"
    dependencies: "External coordination needs"
    
  routing_matrix:
    personal_experience + low_complexity: "one_shot"
    personal_experience + medium_complexity: "mini_workflow"
    business_growth + low_complexity: "mini_workflow"
    business_growth + medium_complexity: "project_structure"
    organizational_coordination + any_complexity: "project_structure"
    civilizational_impact + any_complexity: "multi_project"
```

### **Context-Aware Task Creation**
```yaml
task_creation_process:
  step_1_intent_analysis:
    extract_intent: "What is the human trying to achieve?"
    classify_intent_type: "What scale and domain is this?"
    identify_complexity: "How complex is the implementation?"
    
  step_2_context_resolution:
    find_parent_context: "Which context will contain this task?"
    identify_inheritance: "What universal business goal applies?"
    determine_adaptations: "How does this context differ from universal?"
    
  step_3_routing_decision:
    apply_dynamic_compression: "What execution pattern fits best?"
    assign_executors: "Which agents have relevant capabilities?"
    establish_dependencies: "What needs to happen first?"
    
  step_4_structure_creation:
    create_yaml_metadata: "Intent context + routing + dependencies"
    create_md_implementation: "Full context for autonomous execution"
    link_context_cascade: "Establish inheritance relationships"
```

## ðŸ”„ **SPLITTING AND PIVOTING INTEGRATION**

### **Intent Preservation Through Decomposition**
```yaml
splitting_with_intent:
  trigger: "confidence < 0.8 OR complexity > manageable_threshold"
  
  preservation_protocol:
    maintain_intent: "All sub-tasks inherit same business goal"
    adapt_context: "Each sub-task gets specific implementation focus"
    coordinate_dependencies: "Sub-tasks must work together toward original intent"
    
  sub_task_creation:
    inherit_intent_context: "Same intent_type and business_goal"
    specialize_adaptations: "Focus on specific implementation area"
    maintain_inheritance_chain: "Reference to parent task and context cascade"
    establish_coordination: "Dependencies that ensure intent fulfillment"
```

### **Pivot Impact on Task Structure**
```yaml
pivot_integration:
  implementation_pivot:
    preserve: ["intent_context", "business_goal", "intent_type"]
    update: ["context_adaptations", "implementation_approach", "technical_dependencies"]
    maintain: ["acceptance_criteria", "success_metrics"]
    
  intent_evolution_pivot:
    transform: ["intent_context", "business_goal", "intent_type"]
    rebuild: ["context_adaptations", "acceptance_criteria", "success_metrics"]  
    preserve: ["conversation_context", "decision_history", "learning_insights"]
```

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING APPROACH**

**Unit Tests**: Intent inheritance validation, context cascade resolution, routing decision logic
**Integration Tests**: Task creation from intent, cross-context dependency management, splitting/pivoting workflows
**E2E Tests**: Complete intent â†’ task â†’ execution cycle across different scales and intent types
**Scale Tests**: Same task structure across personal, business, organizational, and civilizational contexts

## ðŸ’¡ **IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES**

### **Intent-First Architecture**
- **Universal Business Goals**: Tasks inherit from reusable business goal contexts
- **Context Adaptation**: Implementation specifics captured as adaptations, not duplications
- **Inheritance Preservation**: Context cascade maintained through all task operations
- **Scale Independence**: Same structure works from dinner planning to planetary coordination

### **Practical Implementation**
- **Dual-File Benefits**: YAML for metadata/routing, MD for rich implementation context
- **BDD Integration**: Acceptance criteria translate directly to test cases
- **Cross-Workspace References**: Business goals shared across implementation boundaries
- **Evolution Tracking**: Complete history of context changes and business goal evolution

**This task structure is the universal foundation for AGI coordination at any scale!** ðŸš€
