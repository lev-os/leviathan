# ðŸŽ¯ CONFIDENCE SYSTEM SPECIFICATION

*Feature extracted from i-split.md*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Confidence-based task decomposition with 80% threshold and recursive splitting
**Value**: Ensures tasks are properly planned before execution, prevents under-prepared implementation
**Priority**: High - Core business logic

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-CONF-001: Confidence Assessment**
```yaml
Given: A task exists
When: assess_task_confidence is called with confidence < 0.8
Then: Task is marked as needing splitting
And: System provides reasoning for low confidence
And: Suggested improvement actions are provided
```

### **AC-CONF-002: Automatic Task Splitting**
```yaml
Given: A task has confidence < 0.8
When: split_task is called
Then: Multiple subtasks are created
And: Each subtask has higher confidence than parent
And: All subtasks combined cover parent task scope
```

### **AC-CONF-003: Research Trigger**
```yaml
Given: A task has confidence < 0.7
When: Confidence assessment is performed
Then: System triggers research mode
And: Perplexity integration provides additional context
And: Confidence is reassessed after research
```

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING APPROACH**

**Unit Tests**: Confidence calculation, threshold validation, splitting logic
**Integration Tests**: Task splitting workflow, research integration
**E2E Tests**: Complete confidence assessment and splitting process
