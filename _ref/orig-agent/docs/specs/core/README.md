# 🏗️ Core Foundation Specs

*The foundational layer that everything in Kingly depends on*

## Overview

This domain contains the core specifications that form the foundation of the Kingly system. These must be implemented first as all other components depend on them.

## Specs in this Domain

### 1. **Intent-Driven Task Structure** ✅
- Universal task format with YAML + MD dual structure
- Intent classification and routing
- Foundation for all work in the system

### 2. **MCP Nexus** ✅
- Central communication layer
- agentInstructions pattern
- Plugin architecture for extensibility

### 3. **Confidence System** ✅
- 80% threshold for task execution
- LLM-based confidence assessment
- Enables intelligent task splitting

### 4. **Memory MVP** ✅
- Hybrid Ultimate MCP + file-based storage
- Semantic search and hierarchical memory
- Foundation for intelligence features

### 5. **Agent as Context Pattern** ✅
- Agents as universal contexts
- Dynamic endpoint assembly
- Enables unlimited agent flexibility

### 6. **Universal Context Architecture** 🔄
- Everything is a context pattern
- Recursive composition
- Meta-system foundation

### 7. **Meta-Language System** 🔄
- Language for system self-description
- Enables self-referential architecture
- Advanced composition patterns

## Implementation Order

1. Intent-Driven Task Structure (foundation)
2. MCP Nexus (communication)
3. Confidence System (decisions)
4. Memory MVP (intelligence)
5. Agent as Context (composition)
6. Universal Context (meta-system)
7. Meta-Language (advanced features)

## Key Insight

These specs form the "context/task system" that enables Kingly to understand and manage itself. Once built, all other specs can be imported as contexts within this foundation.
