# üåÄ UNIVERSAL CONTEXT ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICATION

*Everything is a context, every process is a workflow, every behavior is a configurable rule*

## üìã **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Universal architecture pattern that scales human intent understanding from personal tasks to civilizational coordination through recursive context fractals
**Value**: Single framework handles "order pizza" to "coordinate planetary climate response" with same underlying pattern - everything is a context
**Priority**: High - Foundational architecture for universal AGI systems

## üéØ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-UNIVERSAL-001: Recursive Context Fractal**
```yaml
Given: Any boundary, file, folder, task, project, or workflow
When: System needs to organize or process it
Then: It is represented as a context with context.yaml
And: Contexts can contain other contexts infinitely
And: Every context supports inheritance, workflows, and rules
And: Files are contexts with content, folders are contexts with children
```

### **AC-UNIVERSAL-002: Intent Recognition and Classification**
```yaml
Given: Any human expression of desire or need
When: System processes the intent
Then: Intent is captured in structured format
And: Intent_type is classified for appropriate routing
And: Intent drives all subsequent context creation and routing decisions
And: Same pattern works at personal, business, organizational, and civilizational scales
```

### **AC-UNIVERSAL-003: Polymorphic Context System**
```yaml
Given: Need for any type of boundary (logical, physical, or conceptual)
When: Context is created
Then: Single context.yaml format handles all types through polymorphism
And: Type field determines specific behaviors and metadata
And: Contexts support cascading inheritance through "extends" relationships
And: Cross-context references work across any boundary
```

### **AC-UNIVERSAL-004: YAML Rule Engine**
```yaml
Given: Context with configurable behavior requirements
When: Events occur or conditions are met
Then: YAML-defined rules determine actions
And: No hardcoded behavior - everything is configurable
And: Rules can trigger workflows, create contexts, or modify behavior
And: LLM evaluates conditions semantically, not through keywords
```

### **AC-UNIVERSAL-005: Dynamic Context Assembly**
```yaml
Given: Request requiring context-aware processing
When: System prepares agent or tool execution
Then: Context is dynamically assembled based on situation
And: Assembly includes relevant inheritance chain
And: Injection rules add conditional context
And: Result is optimized for token efficiency
```

## üß† **THE RECURSIVE CONTEXT FRACTAL**

### **Everything is a Context**
```yaml
universal_context_types:
  # Traditional boundaries
  workspace: "Physical isolation boundary (git repo, billing)"
  project: "Logical goal boundary (business objective)"
  task: "Execution boundary (specific deliverable)"
  
  # Everything else is also a context
  file: "Context with content data"
  folder: "Context with child contexts"
  workflow: "Context with execution steps"
  shared_resources: "Context with reusable assets"
  document_collection: "Context with knowledge artifacts"
  agent: "Context with capabilities and behaviors"
  rule_set: "Context with behavioral configurations"
  
  # Infinite extensibility through polymorphism
  custom_type: "Any new type inherits base context behavior"
```

### **Universal Context Schema**
```yaml
# context.yaml - Universal format for ANY context type
metadata:
  id: "unique-identifier"
  type: "workspace|project|task|workflow|file|folder|agent|custom..."
  name: "Human readable name"
  created: timestamp
  updated: timestamp

# Intent and inheritance (all contexts)
intent_context:
  intent_type: "personal_experience|business_growth|organizational_coordination|civilizational_impact"
  business_goal: "What we're fundamentally trying to achieve"
  extends: "reference to parent context (enables inheritance)"
  context_adaptations: "How this context differs from parent"

# Relationships (all contexts)  
relationships:
  depends_on: ["context references"]
  blocks: ["context references"]
  children: ["sub-contexts under this context"]
  shares_with: ["contexts that can access our shared resources"]

# Polymorphic configuration (type-specific)
polymorphic_config:
  # Different fields based on type
  ${type}_specific_fields: "..."

# Behavioral rules (all contexts)
behavior_rules:
  - trigger: "event_type or condition"
    condition: "LLM-evaluated semantic condition"
    action: "workflow to execute or behavior to apply"
    
# Status and execution
status:
  current: "active|inactive|archived|planning"
  progress: 0.0-1.0
  confidence: 0.0-1.0
  blocked_by: "reference to blocking context"
```

```

### **Files and Folders as Contexts**
```yaml
# Even files are contexts
src/auth/login.ts/
  context.yaml:
    type: "file"
    intent_context:
      business_goal: "Handle user login flow"
      extends: "../"

src/auth/
  context.yaml:
    type: "folder"
    business_goal: "Authentication subsystem"
    children: ["login.ts", "logout.ts", "session.ts"]
```

## üí´ **DYNAMIC CONTEXT ASSEMBLY**

### **Runtime Assembly Process**
```yaml
assembly_pipeline:
  1_analyze_request:
    input: "User request or task"
    process: "LLM analyzes intent and context needs"
    output: "Intent classification and requirements"
    
  2_gather_context_chain:

    process: "Walk inheritance chain gathering relevant contexts"
    output: "Full context cascade"
    
  3_evaluate_injection_rules:
    input: "Context chain + current situation"
    process: "LLM evaluates which injection rules apply"
    output: "Additional context to inject"
    
  4_optimize_assembly:

  5_execute_with_context:
    input: "Optimized context + request"
    process: "Execute agent/tool with assembled context"
    output: "Context-aware response"
```

### **Context Whispers**
```yaml
# Periodic check-ins during execution
whisper_system:
  triggers:
    - every_n_tokens: 1000
    - on_complexity_indicator: true
    - on_confidence_drop: true
    
  whisper_types:
    complexity_check:
      message: "Check if this is getting too complex for current approach"
      action: "Consider splitting or escalating"
      
    aha_moment_check:
      message: "Any breakthrough insights to capture?"
      action: "Log to context for pattern learning"
      
    confidence_check:
      message: "Still confident in current direction?"
      action: "Pivot or request human input if needed"
```

## üöÄ **STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS**

### **Immediate Benefits**
- **Universal Pattern**: Everything uses same context system
- **Infinite Flexibility**: New types without architecture changes
- **Dynamic Intelligence**: Context assembled per situation
- **Token Efficiency**: Only relevant context included

### **Long-term Vision**
- **Self-Organizing**: Contexts arrange optimally through rules
- **Pattern Learning**: System discovers what works through usage
- **Universal Scaling**: Personal to planetary with same patterns
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Complex behavior from simple rules

### **The Ultimate Realization**
```yaml
everything_is_context:
  files: "contexts with content"
  folders: "contexts with children"  
  tasks: "contexts with workflows"
  projects: "contexts with sub-contexts"
  workspaces: "contexts with boundaries"
  workflows: "contexts with triggers"
  agents: "contexts with capabilities"
  rules: "contexts with behaviors"
  
# INFINITE RECURSION: contexts all the way down
# INFINITE FLEXIBILITY: any new type fits the pattern
# INFINITE INTELLIGENCE: LLM-driven assembly and rules
```

**The same system that manages a single file can coordinate planetary governance - it's all just contexts with different types and scales.**
