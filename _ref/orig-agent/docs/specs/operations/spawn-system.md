# ðŸ”„ SPAWN SYSTEM SPECIFICATION

*Feature extracted from SPAWN_ARCHITECTURE.md*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Background process management for long-running tasks
**Value**: Keep main conversation responsive while complex operations run in background
**Priority**: Medium - Performance optimization

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-SPAWN-001: Process Spawning**
```yaml
Given: A task requires background execution
When: spawn_process is called
Then: Background process is started
And: Process ID is returned
And: Process status is trackable
```

### **AC-SPAWN-002: Process Lifecycle**
```yaml
Given: A background process is running
When: Checking process status
Then: Current state is available (running/completed/failed)
And: Resource usage is monitored
And: Logs are accessible
```

### **AC-SPAWN-003: Process Cleanup**
```yaml
Given: A background process completes
When: Process finishes or is terminated
Then: Resources are properly cleaned up
And: Final status is recorded
And: Results are available for retrieval
```

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING APPROACH**

**Unit Tests**: Process spawning logic, status tracking, cleanup
**Integration Tests**: Docker/process adapters, lifecycle management
**E2E Tests**: Complete background task execution workflow
