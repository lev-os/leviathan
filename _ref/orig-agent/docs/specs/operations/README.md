# ⚙️ System Operations Specs

*Infrastructure and operational capabilities for Kingly*

## Overview

This domain contains specifications for system-level operations including audit trails, process spawning, dependency management, and experimental features.

## Specs in this Domain

### 1. **Audit Trail** ✅
- Decision logging and tracking
- Queryable audit history
- Compliance and debugging support

### 2. **Spawn System** ✅
- Background task execution
- Docker-based agent spawning
- Asynchronous processing capabilities

### 3. **Cross-Context Dependency Management** 🔄
- Dependency resolution across contexts
- Cross-workspace references
- Circular dependency prevention

### 4. **Experimental Mode** 🔄
- Feature flagging system
- A/B testing capabilities
- Safe experimentation framework

## Implementation Order

1. Audit Trail (needed for debugging)
2. Spawn System (enables background work)
3. Dependency Management (for complex projects)
4. Experimental Mode (for safe feature rollout)

## Key Features

- **Reliability**: Audit trails for every decision
- **Scalability**: Background spawning for long tasks
- **Flexibility**: Experimental mode for testing
- **Robustness**: Dependency management prevents conflicts

## Dependencies

These specs depend on:
- Core foundation (especially MCP Nexus)
- Basic task structure for spawning
- Memory system for audit storage
