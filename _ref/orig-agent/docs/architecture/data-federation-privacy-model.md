# Data Federation and Privacy Model for Kingly OS

## Overview
Privacy-preserving data federation model enabling intelligent sharing between personal and business contexts while maintaining strict boundaries.

## Core Principles

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture
- Each context vault encrypted separately
- Keys controlled by user only
- System never sees raw cross-boundary data
- All sharing requires explicit consent

### Federated Intelligence
- Learn patterns without exposing data
- Share insights not information
- Anonymized cross-context learning
- User-controlled sharing granularity

## Privacy Zones Architecture

```yaml
privacy_zones:
  personal_vault:
    classification: "STRICTLY_PRIVATE"
    contents:
      - health_medical_data
      - family_relationships
      - personal_finances
      - private_goals_dreams
      - intimate_communications
    access: "owner_only"
    
  business_vault:
    classification: "CONFIDENTIAL"
    contents:
      - proprietary_algorithms
      - client_contracts
      - trade_secrets
      - financial_records
      - strategic_plans
    access: "role_based"
    
  shared_zone:
    classification: "FEDERATED"
    contents:
      - productivity_patterns
      - communication_styles
      - decision_frameworks
      - anonymized_insights
      - success_patterns
    access: "bi_directional_approved"
```

## Federation Rules Engine

```yaml
federation_rules:
  sharing_triggers:
    user_initiated:
      - explicit_share_command
      - batch_approval_session
      - rule_creation
      
    system_suggested:
      - pattern_detection
      - optimization_opportunity
      - cross_benefit_identified
      
  approval_mechanisms:
    granular:
      - per_item_approval
      - category_approval
      - time_limited_approval
      
    smart_defaults:
      - safe_patterns_only
      - anonymized_insights
      - no_identifiable_data
```

## Cross-Context Intelligence

```yaml
intelligence_sharing:
  personal_to_business:
    allowed_patterns:
      - "Leadership effectiveness scores"
      - "Communication preference models"
      - "Stress/productivity correlations"
      - "Decision-making frameworks"
    
    blocked_always:
      - "Health specifics"
      - "Family details"
      - "Personal relationships"
      
  business_to_personal:
    allowed_patterns:
      - "Time management techniques"
      - "Negotiation strategies"
      - "Problem-solving frameworks"
      - "Success celebration patterns"
    
    blocked_always:
      - "Client information"
      - "Proprietary methods"
      - "Competitive intelligence"
```

## Implementation Mechanisms

### Secure Sharing Protocol
```yaml
sharing_protocol:
  request:
    - context_requests_data
    - system_validates_permission
    - user_approval_required
    - data_sanitized
    - transfer_logged
    
  sanitization:
    - remove_identifiers
    - generalize_specifics
    - abstract_patterns
    - verify_anonymity
```

### Audit Trail System
```yaml
audit_system:
  every_access:
    - timestamp
    - requesting_context
    - data_requested
    - approval_status
    - sanitization_applied
    
  user_controls:
    - view_all_access_logs
    - revoke_permissions
    - delete_shared_data
    - export_audit_trail
```

## Privacy-Preserving Features

### Differential Privacy
- Add statistical noise to patterns
- Preserve insights while protecting specifics
- Configurable privacy budget
- Automatic threshold enforcement

### Homomorphic Learning
- Learn on encrypted data
- Never decrypt during processing
- Results only visible to owner
- Cross-context insights without exposure

### Secure Multi-Party Computation
- Multiple contexts collaborate
- No context sees others' data
- Combined insights generated
- Privacy mathematically guaranteed

## User Control Interface

```yaml
user_controls:
  privacy_dashboard:
    - view_all_zones
    - manage_permissions
    - audit_access_logs
    - configure_sharing_rules
    
  sharing_wizard:
    - guided_setup
    - preview_before_share
    - impact_analysis
    - rollback_capability
    
  emergency_controls:
    - instant_lockdown
    - revoke_all_sharing
    - data_export
    - complete_deletion
```

## Compliance Framework

### Regulatory Alignment
- GDPR compliant design
- CCPA privacy rights
- HIPAA for health data
- SOC 2 for business data

### Privacy by Design
- Minimal data collection
- Purpose limitation
- Data minimization
- Default privacy settings

## Technical Implementation

### Encryption Layers
```yaml
encryption:
  at_rest:
    - AES-256 per vault
    - Separate key per context
    - Hardware security module
    
  in_transit:
    - TLS 1.3 minimum
    - Certificate pinning
    - Perfect forward secrecy
    
  in_use:
    - Secure enclaves
    - Trusted execution
    - Memory encryption
```

### Access Control
```yaml
access_control:
  authentication:
    - Multi-factor required
    - Biometric options
    - Hardware key support
    
  authorization:
    - Role-based access
    - Attribute-based control
    - Time-based permissions
    
  zero_trust:
    - Verify every access
    - Assume breach
    - Minimal privilege
```
