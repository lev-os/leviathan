# Master Context Engine - Kingly OS Integration

## Overview
Integration of Master Context Engine concept with Kingly OS's cascading context system and memory architecture.

## Core Innovation
Combine structured context injection (Master Context Engine) with our workflow-based memory system for cascading, inheritable contexts.

## Enhanced Context Structure

### Hierarchical Context System
```yaml
context_hierarchy:
  master_context:
    personal:
      roles_responsibilities: "< 200 words"
      strengths_weaknesses: "< 200 words"
      personal_values: "< 200 words"
      
    business:
      company_info: "< 200 words"
      team_structure: "< 200 words"
      processes_protocols: "< 200 words"
      
    shared_slice:
      approved_for_business: []
      sanitized_personal_insights: []
      cross_context_learnings: []

  context_cascading:
    inheritance: "child contexts inherit from parent"
    overrides: "specific contexts override general"
    privacy_boundaries: "explicit sharing rules"
    evolution: "contexts learn and adapt over time"
```

### Framework Integration
```yaml
framework_templates:
  strategic:
    - Dalio5Step: "5-step success process"
    - OODAProcess: "Observe-Orient-Decide-Act"
    - PreMortem: "Failure prevention"
    
  creative:
    - DesignThink: "5-stage design process"
    - ExplainItSimple: "Feynman technique"
    
  coaching:
    - GROWCoach: "Goal-Reality-Options-Will"
    - MinimizeRegret: "Decision framework"
    
  business:
    - CustomerPersonaBuilder
    - CompetitiveLandscapeMap
    - ValuePropGenerator
    - PricingStrategySim
```

## Memory System Enhancement

### Context-Aware Memory Selection
```yaml
memory_routing:
  master_context_queries:
    primary: "OpenMemory MCP"  # Fast, local, private
    fallback: "Zep"           # Temporal awareness
    
  framework_execution:
    reasoning: "PathRAG"       # Complex multi-step
    validation: "Self-Consistency"
    evolution: "Neural Graffiti"
```

### Cascading Memory Updates
```yaml
memory_cascading:
  update_propagation:
    - "Child context learns → bubbles to parent"
    - "Parent insight → trickles to children"
    - "Sibling contexts → cross-pollinate"
    
  privacy_preservation:
    - "Explicit boundaries maintained"
    - "Sanitization before sharing"
    - "Audit trail for all cascades"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Structure
- Implement Master Context loading
- Create inheritance system
- Basic privacy boundaries

### Phase 2: Framework Integration
- Port all framework templates
- Connect to reasoning techniques
- Enable context-aware execution

### Phase 3: Memory Cascading
- Implement update propagation
- Create learning patterns
- Enable cross-context insights

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Real-time context evolution
- Multi-agent context sharing
- Performance optimization

## Key Benefits

### For Users
- One-time context setup
- Consistent AI interactions
- Privacy-preserved sharing
- Automatic improvement

### For System
- Reduced token usage
- Better reasoning context
- Faster response times
- Learning accumulation

## Integration Points

### With Advanced Techniques
- Step-Back Prompting uses master principles
- Multi-Agent Reasoning shares team context
- Constitutional AI enforces value boundaries
- Few-Shot Learning uses personalized examples

### With Memory Systems
- OpenMemory stores personal vault
- Neo4j models team relationships
- Zep tracks context evolution
- Neural Graffiti enables drift

## Privacy Architecture

### Data Isolation
```yaml
isolation_levels:
  strict: "No cross-boundary access"
  federated: "Explicit sharing only"
  learning: "Anonymized patterns only"
```

### Consent Management
```yaml
consent_flows:
  one_time: "Initial setup consent"
  per_share: "Each boundary crossing"
  learning: "Pattern extraction consent"
```

## Success Metrics

### Performance
- Context load time < 100ms
- Inheritance resolution < 50ms
- Update cascading < 200ms

### Quality
- Context relevance > 90%
- Privacy boundary violations = 0
- User satisfaction > 95%

### Scale
