# Tree of Thoughts (ToT) - Branching Reasoning Workflow

## Overview
Tree of Thoughts extends Chain of Thought by introducing **branching exploration** at each reasoning step. Instead of following a single linear path, the LLM generates multiple alternative continuations, evaluates them, and selects the most promising paths to continue exploring.

## Core Mechanism
- **Branching**: Generate k alternative continuations at each step
- **Evaluation**: Score each branch using criteria or self-critique
- **Pruning**: Keep only top-N promising branches
- **Exploration**: Recursively expand selected branches until solution found

## Performance Benefits
- **Superior accuracy** on complex reasoning, planning, and puzzle tasks
- **Hypothesis testing** capability through alternative exploration
- **Backtracking** when reasoning paths prove unproductive
- **Robustness** in multi-step logical deduction scenarios

## Scaling Benefits

### Traditional Single-Call Approach

- No external validation of intermediate steps
- Black-box reasoning process

### MCP Multi-Call Approach
