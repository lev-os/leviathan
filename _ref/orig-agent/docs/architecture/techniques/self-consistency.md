# Self-Consistency - Multiple Path Consensus Workflow

## Overview
Self-Consistency improves reasoning reliability by generating **multiple diverse reasoning paths** for the same problem, then selecting the most consistent answer through consensus mechanisms. This approach significantly reduces errors by favoring solutions that are robust across multiple reasoning trajectories.

## Core Mechanism
- **Multiple Path Generation**: Create diverse reasoning approaches to same problem
- **Stochastic Sampling**: Use temperature/nucleus sampling for path diversity
- **Consensus Building**: Identify most frequent or well-supported answers
- **Quality Filtering**: Remove incoherent or contradictory reasoning paths
- **Confidence Assessment**: Weight paths by reasoning quality and consistency

## Performance Benefits
- **68% accuracy** vs 51.7% single-path on GSM8K arithmetic (30 paths, T=1.0)
- **4-18 percentage point gains** across various reasoning benchmarks
- **Error reduction** through robust multi-path validation
- **Improved reliability** by favoring consistent solutions
- **Better handling** of complex multi-step reasoning tasks
