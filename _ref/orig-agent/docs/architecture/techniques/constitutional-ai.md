# Constitutional AI - Rule-Based Behavior Alignment Workflow

## Overview
Constitutional AI ensures LLM behavior aligns with **explicit ethical principles and rules** through systematic constitution enforcement. This approach creates transparent, auditable behavior governance by checking outputs against defined principles and correcting violations through iterative refinement.

## Core Mechanism
- **Constitution Definition**: Explicit set of normative principles governing AI behavior
- **Compliance Checking**: Systematic evaluation of outputs against constitutional rules
- **Violation Detection**: Identification of specific rule breaches and reasoning
- **Corrective Revision**: Generation of improved outputs that comply with constitution
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement through self-critique cycles

## Performance Benefits
- **40.8% reduction** in attack success rate on safety evaluations
- **Improved harmlessness** and reduced unintended bias in outputs
- **Enhanced transparency** through explicit rule-based reasoning
- **Consistent value alignment** across diverse scenarios and contexts
- **Auditable behavior** with clear constitutional compliance tracking

- **Systematic Review**: Comprehensive evaluation of each constitutional principle
- **Transparent Governance**: Clear audit trail of constitutional compliance process
- **Iterative Improvement**: Multiple correction cycles for complex violations
- **Quality Assurance**: External validation of constitutional adherence
- **Adaptive Enforcement**: Configurable strictness levels for different contexts

## Integration with Safety Systems

### Multi-Layer Safety Architecture

### Alignment Framework Integration
- **RLHF Enhancement**: Constitutional principles guide reward modeling
- **Value Learning**: Constitutional rules inform value alignment training
- **Preference Elicitation**: Constitutional principles help define human preferences
