# Graph of Thoughts (GoT) - Network Reasoning Workflow

## Overview
Graph of Thoughts extends Tree of Thoughts by using **arbitrary graph structures** instead of strict hierarchies. This enables merging reasoning paths, feedback loops, and dynamic relationship modeling between thoughts - perfect for complex, cross-linked reasoning tasks.

## Core Mechanism
- **Nodes**: Individual thoughts, hypotheses, or partial solutions
- **Edges**: Relationships, dependencies, or logical connections  
- **Graph Structure**: Non-hierarchical network allowing cycles and merging
- **Dynamic Evolution**: Graph structure adapts as reasoning progresses

## Advantages Over Tree/Chain Approaches
- **Efficiency**: Merge redundant reasoning paths instead of exploring separately
- **Quality**: Feedback loops enable iterative refinement of earlier thoughts
- **Flexibility**: Handle cross-cutting dependencies and non-linear reasoning
- **Scalability**: Suitable for complex domains with interconnected concepts
