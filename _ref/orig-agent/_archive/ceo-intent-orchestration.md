# ðŸ‘‘ CEO INTENT ORCHESTRATION SPECIFICATION

*Enhanced CEO agent with intent-context intelligence and dynamic compression mastery*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: CEO agent enhanced with intent recognition, context cascade management, and dynamic compression intelligence
**Value**: Universal orchestrator that handles everything from personal tasks to civilizational coordination
**Priority**: High - Core agent enhancement with universal scaling capabilities

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-CEO-001: Intent Recognition and Classification**
```yaml
Given: Any human expression of desire, need, or goal
When: CEO processes the request
Then: CEO extracts intent and classifies intent_type accurately
And: CEO performs complexity analysis for appropriate routing
And: CEO creates or references appropriate context cascade
And: CEO applies dynamic compression for optimal execution pathway
```

### **AC-CEO-002: Context Cascade Orchestration**
```yaml
Given: Intent requiring implementation through context hierarchy
When: CEO manages context creation and inheritance
Then: CEO establishes proper context cascade with inheritance chains
And: CEO ensures business goal preservation through context adaptations
And: CEO coordinates cross-context dependencies and relationships
And: CEO maintains context coherence while enabling flexibility
```

```

## âš¡ **DYNAMIC COMPRESSION MASTERY**

```yaml
compression_decision_matrix:
  factors:
    intent_complexity: "Extracted from intent analysis"
    implementation_scope: "Technical and coordination requirements"
    stakeholder_count: "Number of people/systems affected"
    uncertainty_level: "Confidence in approach and requirements"
    time_sensitivity: "Urgency and timeline constraints"
    
  routing_logic:
    if complexity < 0.3 AND stakeholders = 1: "one_shot"
    elif complexity < 0.6 AND stakeholders < 5: "mini_workflow"
    elif complexity < 0.8 OR intent_type = "business_growth": "project_structure"
    elif intent_type = "organizational_coordination": "multi_project"
    elif intent_type = "civilizational_impact": "multi_workspace"
    
  adaptive_override:
