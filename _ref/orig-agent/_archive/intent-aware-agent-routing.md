# ðŸŽ¯ INTENT-AWARE AGENT ROUTING SPECIFICATION

*Agent assignment and coordination based on intent-context analysis*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Intelligent agent routing that assigns optimal agents based on intent type and context requirements
**Value**: Right agents for right tasks at right scale, from personal assistants to civilization coordinators
**Priority**: High - Core agent orchestration with intent intelligence

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-ROUTING-001: Intent-Driven Agent Assignment**
```yaml
Given: Task with intent_type and context requirements
When: Agent routing decision is made
Then: Agents assigned based on intent characteristics and complexity
And: Agent capabilities match intent requirements and implementation scope
And: Agent coordination patterns adapt to intent type
And: Same routing engine works across all scales
```

## ðŸ¤– **AGENT ASSIGNMENT MATRIX**

```yaml
agent_routing_by_intent:
  personal_experience:
    primary_agents: ["personal_assistant", "lifestyle_optimizer", "wellness_coach"]
    coordination_style: "sequential_with_feedback"
    decision_authority: "user_preference_driven"
    
  business_growth:
    primary_agents: ["ceo", "dev", "ux", "marketing"]
    coordination_style: "parallel_with_integration_points"
    decision_authority: "ceo_orchestrated"
    
  organizational_coordination:
    primary_agents: ["ceo", "operations", "hr", "strategy", "change_management"]
    coordination_style: "phased_rollout_with_stakeholder_alignment"
    decision_authority: "multi_stakeholder_consensus"
    
  civilizational_impact:
    primary_agents: ["policy_designer", "implementation_coordinator", "stakeholder_liaison", "impact_monitor"]
    coordination_style: "multi_stakeholder_orchestration_with_governance"
    decision_authority: "distributed_democratic_consensus"
```

## âš¡ **DYNAMIC AGENT SCALING**

```yaml
scaling_patterns:
  simple_tasks: "single_agent_with_tools"
  moderate_tasks: "primary_agent_plus_specialist_support" 
  complex_tasks: "full_agent_team_with_defined_roles"
  enterprise_systems: "multiple_coordinated_agent_teams"
  
routing_intelligence:
  "When complexity < 0.3": "Route to single most appropriate agent"
  "When 0.3 < complexity < 0.7": "Route to primary + supporting agents"
  "When complexity > 0.7": "Route to full coordination team"
  "When multi-workspace": "Route to distributed agent network"
```

This creates intelligent agent assignment that scales appropriately with intent complexity!
