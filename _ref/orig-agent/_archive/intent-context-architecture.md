# üß† INTENT-CONTEXT ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICATION

*Universal pattern for AGI coordination from personal tasks to planetary governance*

## üìã **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Universal architecture pattern that scales human intent understanding from personal tasks to civilizational coordination
**Value**: Single framework handles "order pizza" to "coordinate planetary climate response" with same underlying pattern
**Priority**: High - Foundational architecture for universal AGI systems

## üéØ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-INTENT-001: Intent Recognition and Classification**
```yaml
Given: Any human expression of desire or need
When: System processes the intent
Then: Intent is captured in structured format
And: Intent_type is classified for appropriate routing
And: Intent drives all subsequent context creation and routing decisions
And: Same pattern works at personal, business, organizational, and civilizational scales
```

### **AC-INTENT-002: Polymorphic Context System**
```yaml
Given: Intent requires implementation context
When: Context objects are created or referenced
Then: Each context has type (project | workspace) with shared metadata structure
And: Contexts support cascading inheritance through "extends" relationships
And: Context adaptations customize inherited business goals for specific implementations
And: Physical boundaries (workspaces) contain logical boundaries (projects)
```

### **AC-INTENT-003: Universal Context Cascade Pattern**
```yaml
Given: Intent of any complexity level
When: System determines implementation approach
Then: Intent flows through: Intent ‚Üí Intent_Type ‚Üí Context Cascade ‚Üí Implementation
And: Same pattern applies to dating apps, client projects, government systems, planetary coordination
And: Context inheritance enables business goal reuse across different implementation contexts
And: Dependencies can reference contexts across workspace boundaries
```

### **AC-INTENT-004: Intent-Driven Dynamic Compression**
```yaml
Given: Intent with specific intent_type and complexity characteristics
When: System routes for execution
Then: Compression level is determined by intent analysis (complexity + scope + urgency)
And: Personal_experience intents route to one-shot or mini-workflow
And: Business_growth intents route to project structure or mini-workflow
And: Organizational_coordination intents route to full project structure
And: Civilizational_impact intents route to multi-workspace coordination
```

## üåä **INTENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM**

### **Intent Types and Routing Matrix**
```yaml
intent_types:
  personal_experience:
    description: "Individual needs, desires, personal growth"
    examples: ["romantic connection", "health improvement", "skill development"]
    typical_complexity: low_to_medium
    default_routing: one_shot_to_mini_workflow
    
  business_growth:
    description: "Revenue generation, customer value, operational efficiency"
    examples: ["customer acquisition", "revenue optimization", "user authentication"]
    typical_complexity: medium
    default_routing: mini_workflow_to_project
    
  organizational_coordination:

```

### **Intent Processing Pipeline**
```yaml
intent_pipeline:
  step_1_capture:
    input: "Raw human expression"
    process: "Extract core desire/need/goal"
    output: "Structured intent object"
    
  step_2_classification:
    input: "Structured intent"
    process: "LLM analysis for intent_type classification"
    output: "Intent with type and routing hints"
    
  step_3_context_resolution:
    input: "Classified intent"
    process: "Find existing contexts or create new ones"
    output: "Context cascade from universal to specific"
    
  step_4_implementation_routing:
    input: "Intent + context cascade"
    process: "Dynamic compression analysis"
    output: "Execution pathway (one-shot to multi-workspace)"
```

## üèóÔ∏è **POLYMORPHIC CONTEXT ARCHITECTURE**

### **Universal Context Schema**
```yaml
# Every context (project OR workspace) follows this structure
context.yaml:
  # Shared metadata (all context types)
  metadata:
    id: "unique-identifier"
    type: "project" | "workspace"
    created: timestamp
    updated: timestamp
    intent_source: "reference to originating intent"
    
  # Dependencies and relationships
  relationships:
    extends: "reference to parent context (for inheritance)"
    depends_on: ["list of context references"]
    blocks: ["list of contexts this blocks"]
    
  # Polymorphic metadata (type-specific)
  if type == "workspace":
    workspace_config:
      path/url: "filesystem location/protocol"
      isolation_boundary: "git repo, billing boundary, security context"
      default_projects: ["maintenance", "security", "experiments"]
      
  if type == "project":
    project_config:
      business_goal: "what we're trying to achieve"
      intent_type: "personal_experience | business_growth | organizational_coordination | civilizational_impact"
      context_adaptations: "how this differs from parent context"
      implementation_notes: "specific requirements for this context"
```

### **Context Inheritance Examples**

#### **Universal to Specific Cascade**
```yaml

    intent_type: business_growth
    
# Workspace implementation boundary  
contexts/client-abc/
  context.yaml:
    type: workspace
    physical_path: "~/digital/client-abc/"
    
# Specific implementation context
contexts/client-abc/projects/auth-ecommerce/
  context.yaml:
    type: project
    extends: "../../../user-authentication"
    intent_type: business_growth
    context_adaptations: "E-commerce payment integration, PCI compliance"
    business_goal: "Secure user authentication" # inherited
```

#### **Cross-Scale Context Examples**

  romantic-experiences/ (universal business goal)
  ‚Üí local-life/ (workspace boundary)  
  ‚Üí tonights-date/ (specific implementation)
  
routing: one_shot_execution

## üß™ **TESTING APPROACH**

**Unit Tests**: Intent classification accuracy, context inheritance validation, routing decision correctness
**Integration Tests**: Intent ‚Üí context ‚Üí implementation pipeline, cross-workspace dependency resolution  
**E2E Tests**: Complete intent processing from "order pizza" to "coordinate climate response"
**Scale Tests**: Same pattern validation across personal, business, organizational, civilizational scales

## üí° **IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES**

### **Universal Pattern Philosophy**
- **Same Architecture**: Dating apps and tax systems use identical intent-context patterns
- **Emergent Complexity**: Simple intent processing enables complex coordination through composition
- **Scale Independence**: Pattern works from individual tasks to planetary governance
- **Context Reuse**: Business goals extend across implementation boundaries for maximum leverage

### **AGI Coordination Foundation**
- **Intent Understanding**: Universal pattern for processing human desires at any scale
- **Context Inheritance**: Enables coordination across logical and physical boundaries
- **Dynamic Compression**: Intelligent routing based on intent characteristics
- **Recursive Scaling**: Same pattern recursively applies to enable unlimited complexity coordination

## üöÄ **STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS**

This architecture provides the foundation for:
- **Personal AI**: Intelligent task management from trivial to complex
- **Business AI**: Scalable project coordination across teams and clients  
- **Organizational AI**: Strategic planning and resource coordination
- **Civilizational AI**: Governance systems and planetary resource coordination

**The same kingly system that plans your dinner can coordinate global climate response.**
