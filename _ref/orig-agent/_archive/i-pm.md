business_context:
  goal: "Allow users to create accounts for fitness tracking"
  business_value: "Enable user retention and personalized experience"
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "User can register with email/password"
    - "Email validation required"
    - "Secure password requirements enforced"
    - "Account activation via email"

    ## Architecture Input (CEO ‚Üí Dev handoff)
    
    ### Approach
    - Use Firebase Auth for user management
    - Implement custom validation layer
    - Store additional user metadata in Firestore
    
    ### Security Requirements
    - Password: min 8 chars, special chars required
    - Rate limiting on registration endpoints
    - Email verification before account activation
    
    ### Integration Points
    - Connect to user profile system (profile-001)
    - Integrate with analytics for signup tracking

    ## Implementation Log (Dev execution)
    
    ### Progress Notes
    - ‚úÖ Set up Firebase Auth configuration
    - ‚úÖ Created registration form component
    - ‚è≥ Working on email validation flow
    - ‚ùå Discovered Firebase SDK compatibility issue with React Native
    
    ### Technical Decisions
    - Using Formik for form handling
    - Yup for validation schema
    - Custom hooks for auth state management
    
    ### Blockers Found
    - Firebase Web SDK required for React Native (not native SDK)
    - Need to resolve before profile integration

decision_log:
  - timestamp: "2025-01-25T10:30:00.000Z"
    role: "ceo"
    decision: "Use Firebase Auth instead of custom auth"
    rationale: "Faster time to market, proven security, handles edge cases"
    impact: "Reduces development time by ~2 weeks"
    
  - timestamp: "2025-01-25T14:00:00.000Z"
    role: "dev"
    decision: "Task blocked due to SDK compatibility"

## **Pivot Task Example**
```yaml
# .memory/fitness-app/tasks/pivot-001.yaml
metadata:
  id: "pivot-001"
  title: "Switch from React Native to Web-Only"
  type: "pivot"

ownership:
  owner: "ceo"
  executors: ["dev", "ceo"]  # Both involved in pivot
  created_by: "ceo"

business_context:
  goal: "Simplify technical stack and accelerate development"
  business_value: "Faster time to market, reduced complexity"
  rationale: |
    React Native compatibility issues causing delays.
    Web-first approach allows faster iteration and easier deployment.
    Mobile web experience sufficient for MVP.
