# i-steps: Implementation Steps (Evolutionary Approach)

*Step-by-step implementation focusing on upgrading ourselves first*

## 🎯 **Step 1: Self-Upgrade with Generated Components** (Current Priority)

### **What We Have Working**
- ✅ TagSoup routing (better than agent-cli approach)
- ✅ Enhanced orchestrator (791 lines, proven LLM routing)
- ✅ CEO → DEV handoffs (validated in real work)
- ✅ Synthetic agent factory (on-demand specialists)
- ✅ **Generated components** (77.8% success rate!) ← **START HERE**

### **Generated Components to Integrate**
```
seed/generated/
├── orchestrator.js         # Production orchestrator (auto-generated)
├── routing-engine.js       # Three-tier routing system  
├── agent-registry.js       # Dynamic agent management
├── capability-system.js    # Workflow templates
└── claude-spawner.js       # Docker multi-instance management
```

### **Step 1 Tasks**
- [ ] Compare generated/orchestrator.js vs seed/enhanced-orchestrator.js
- [ ] Test generated routing-engine.js vs seed/tag-soup-router.js  
- [ ] Integrate generated agent-registry.js with existing agent system
- [ ] Test generated capability-system.js 
- [ ] Validate generated claude-spawner.js for future spawning needs

**Goal**: Upgrade ourselves with our own successful self-generation before looking elsewhere

## 🔮 **Future Steps** (Assess After Step 1)

### **Step 2: Assess What We Actually Need**
After self-upgrade, evaluate:
- Do we need anything from agent-cli? (probably just terminal package ideas)
- Do we need anything from agent-mcp? (probably just MCP protocol implementation)
- What's our actual gap vs what we thought we needed?

### **Step 3: Targeted Integration** 
Only integrate what we determine we actually need after Step 2

### **Step 4: Package Strategy**
- Core: kingly-agent (our upgraded system)
- Terminal package: For non-Claude Code users (agent-cli concepts)
- MCP package: Protocol implementation (agent-mcp concepts)

## 🤔 **Key Insights**

### **We Already Have Better Routing**
- TagSoup router > agent-cli pattern matching
- Enhanced orchestrator > agent-cli orchestration
- Why integrate worse routing when ours is proven?

### **Agent-CLI is Different Use Case**
- agent-cli = terminal users without Claude Code
- kingly-agent = agent mode users with Claude Code
- These can be separate packages, agent-cli builds on top of kingly-agent

### **Generated Components are Proven**
- 77.8% test pass rate during self-build
- System successfully built better versions of itself
- Why not use our own successful output?

**Current Focus**: Step 1 only - upgrade ourselves with our successful generated components
**Next Session**: Assess what we actually need from other projects after self-upgrade
