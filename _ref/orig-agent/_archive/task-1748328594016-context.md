# Enhanced Workflows System - Complexity Assessment

## Following i-split.md Confidence Methodology

### Task: Implement Enhanced Workflows System
**Goal:** Create workflow template library and multi-agent execution patterns from i-wkflw.md

## Confidence Assessment

**Initial Overall Confidence: 3/10** ❌ (Well below 8 threshold)

### Complexity Breakdown:

1. **Workflow Template System** (Confidence: 6/10)
   - YAML-based workflow definitions
   - Agent capability hint system
   - Multiple workflow patterns (research_first, write_first, etc.)
   - **Issue:** Complex pattern matching and LLM integration

2. **Multi-Agent Execution Engine** (Confidence: 4/10)
   - Agent routing based on capabilities
   - Dynamic workflow step execution
   - Context passing between agents
   - **Issue:** Complex orchestration logic

3. **Template & Checklist Integration** (Confidence: 7/10)
   - Template system for workflows
   - Dynamic checklist generation
   - **Issue:** Integration with existing task system

4. **LLM Workflow Hints** (Confidence: 5/10)
   - Smart workflow suggestions
   - Context-aware pattern selection
   - **Issue:** LLM integration complexity

## Split Decision: YES - MUST SPLIT

**Reason:** Multiple complex subsystems, unclear integration points, high coordination needed

## Proposed Task Splitting:

### Subtask 1: Workflow Template Parser (Confidence: 8/10) ✅
- Read YAML workflow definitions
- Parse agent capabilities
- Load workflow patterns
- **Estimate:** 2-3 hours

### Subtask 2: Basic Workflow Execution (Confidence: 8/10) ✅  
- Simple linear workflow execution
- Agent routing by capability
- Basic context passing
- **Estimate:** 3-4 hours

### Subtask 3: Dynamic Pattern Selection (Confidence: 7/10) ⚠️
- LLM-driven workflow selection
- Context-aware hints
- **May need further splitting**

### Subtask 4: Integration with Task System (Confidence: 8/10) ✅
- Connect workflows to enhanced tasks
- Checklist integration
- **Estimate:** 2 hours

## Architecture Decisions:

1. **Start Simple:** Linear workflows before dynamic patterns
2. **Separate Concerns:** Parser, executor, integration as separate modules
3. **Incremental:** Build up complexity gradually
4. **Test Each Layer:** Validate each subtask independently

## Next Action:
**Execute Subtask 1 first** - Build the foundation with high confidence
