# ðŸš€ PROJECT STRUCTURE SPECIFICATION

*Feature extracted from i-pm.md, i-workspace.md*

## ðŸ“‹ **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Each project is a directory with proper metadata and task organization
**Value**: Version-controllable project structure that supports developer workflows
**Priority**: High - Critical foundation

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-PROJ-001: Project Directory Creation**
```yaml
Given: A workspace "my-workspace" exists
When: create_project is called with name "Payment System"
Then: A directory "my-workspace/payment-system/" is created
And: A "my-workspace/payment-system/project.yaml" file is created
And: A "my-workspace/payment-system/tasks/" directory is created
And: The project appears in list_projects for that workspace
```

### **AC-PROJ-002: Project Metadata**
```yaml
Given: A project exists
When: Reading project.yaml
Then: It contains name, workspace, description, created date
And: It lists associated tasks
And: The format is valid YAML
```

### **AC-PROJ-003: Project Task Organization**
```yaml
Given: A project "payment-system" exists
When: Tasks are created for the project
Then: Tasks are stored in "payment-system/tasks/" directory
And: Each task has both YAML and MD files
And: Project metadata references all associated tasks
```

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING APPROACH**

**Unit Tests**: Project name validation, YAML structure validation
**Integration Tests**: Directory creation, task organization, metadata updates
**E2E Tests**: Complete project lifecycle, task integration
