Analysis Complete - Writer Project Status

  ✅ What's Complete:

  1. All 10 roles defined with prompts in 3 locations:
    - /prompts/ - Original role prompts
    - /ai/custom-modes/ - Enhanced custom mode versions
    - /consolidated/ - Best-of-both consolidated versions
  2. Templates created for each role in /templates/:
    - Role-specific templates (research briefs, verification reports, etc.)
    - Content type templates (article, newsletter, tweet)
    - Empty directories for book, blog-series, newsletter-series
  3. Output directory structure ready with folders for each role
  4. Documentation:
    - Main README explaining the WRITE Method
    - Workflow.txt with comprehensive methodology
    - Consolidated README with usage instructions

  🔴 What's Missing:

  1. Book/Blog/Newsletter series templates - Directories exist but no templates inside
  2. No actual content - All output directories are empty (expected for a template repo)
  3. No example project demonstrating the workflow in action

  🎯 Next Steps:

  1. Create missing templates for book, blog-series, and newsletter-series
  2. Test the workflow with a sample project
  3. Package as reusable template (GitHub template repo or similar)
  4. Create quickstart guide showing how to use the WRITE Method

> how is the system supposd to be used? is there a web gui?

⏺ Let me check how the WRITE Method is designed to be used:

⏺ Search(pattern: "gui|interface|UI|web|app|application|frontend|usage|how to use", path: "writer")…
  ⎿  Found 47 files (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me check the main documentation for usage instructions:

⏺ Read(writer/output/README.md)…
  ⎿  Read 8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(writer/consolidated/README.md)…
  ⎿  Read 17 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ No Web GUI - AI Agent-Based System

  The WRITE Method is designed to work with AI coding assistants like:
  - VSCode with AI extensions
  - Cursor IDE
  - Claude (via API or chat)
  - Other LLM-powered coding environments

  How it works:
  1. Copy a role prompt from /consolidated/ folder
  2. Paste into AI assistant as a system prompt or custom instruction
  3. AI assumes that role and performs the work
  4. Files are saved to appropriate directories
  5. Next role picks up where previous left off

  No traditional UI - it's a prompt-based workflow where:
  - Each role has detailed instructions
  - AI agents read/write files directly
  - Memory logs track progress between roles
  - Handoffs happen via file system

  Think of it like a "prompt chain" where each AI persona completes their part and passes work to the next role through the shared file structure.

     ## Executive Summary
     Eighty-five percent of AI projects fail.
     This isn't a typo. Despite $46 billion invested in AI infrastructure in 2024, enterprises are burning through millions with little to show for it. The average AI deployment takes 6-12 months and requires
     juggling 20+ different tools—if it reaches production at all.
     We're building the solution: a unified AI infrastructure platform that makes deployment 10x faster through proprietary automation and intelligent orchestration. Think of us as selling picks and shovels in
      the AI gold rush—while everyone else fights for model supremacy, we're building the critical infrastructure layer that makes any AI model actually work in production.

     and still has an 85% chance of failure.
