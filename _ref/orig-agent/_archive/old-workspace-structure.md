# üèóÔ∏è WORKSPACE STRUCTURE SPECIFICATION

*Feature extracted from i-workspace.md*

## üìã **BUSINESS CASE**

**Goal**: Provide hierarchical project organization with filesystem-based persistence
**Value**: Context-aware project management that integrates with existing developer workflows
**Priority**: High - Foundation for all other features

## üéØ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

### **AC-WS-001: Workspace Directory Creation**
```yaml
Given: A workspace name "My Awesome Project"
When: create_workspace is called
Then: A directory named "my-awesome-project" is created
And: A workspace.yaml file exists in that directory
And: The workspace appears in list_workspaces output
```

### **AC-WS-002: Workspace Metadata**
```yaml
Given: A workspace exists
When: Reading workspace.yaml
Then: It contains name, description, created date, project list
And: The format is valid YAML
And: Required fields are not empty
```

### **AC-WS-003: Workspace Onboarding**
```yaml
Given: No memory found for current workspace
When: Agent detects workspace context
Then: CEO agent analyzes workspace and creates PRD
And: Agent orchestration determines needed agents
And: Workspace memory is established
```

## üß™ **TESTING APPROACH**

**Unit Tests**: YAML validation, name slugification, directory structure validation
**Integration Tests**: Filesystem operations, MCP tool responses, workspace discovery
**E2E Tests**: Complete workspace creation workflow, onboarding process
