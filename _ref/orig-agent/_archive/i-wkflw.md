# Workflow Architecture: Pure Flexibility with Smart Hints

## Core Philosophy

Workflows are **hints, not rules**. The LLM decides how to display options based on context, user preferences, and what makes sense.

## Workflow Structure

```yaml
# workflows/content-creation.yaml
goal: "Create content (blog, article, documentation)"

# Hints for LLM - not rigid requirements
agents:
  - researcher: {capabilities: [gather_info, verify_facts, trend_analysis]}
  - writer: {capabilities: [outline, draft, edit, structure]}  
  - fact_checker: {capabilities: [verify_claims, check_sources, validate]}
  - designer: {capabilities: [visuals, layout, infographics]}
  - editor: {capabilities: [proofread, polish, style_check]}

# Common patterns (LLM uses as inspiration)
steps:
  research_first: [researcher, writer, fact_checker, editor]
  write_first: [writer, researcher, fact_checker, editor]  
  visual_heavy: [researcher, designer, writer, editor]
  minimal_viable: [writer, fact_checker]
  full_production: [researcher, writer, fact_checker, designer, editor, reviewer]

# Optional checklists (LLM can suggest)
checklists:
  content_quality:
    - [ ] Key points clearly stated
    - [ ] Target audience appropriate
    - [ ] Facts verified
    - [ ] Engaging introduction
    - [ ] Strong conclusion
    - [ ] Visual elements support content

# Templates LLM can reference
templates:
  - blog_post_structure
  - technical_tutorial  
  - thought_leadership
  - company_announcement

# LLM display strategy
display_strategy: |
  Analyze the user's request and context to determine:
  1. What's the most logical first step?
  2. What are 2-3 alternative approaches?
  3. Are there any red flags to mention?
  4. Should I suggest a full sequence or ask for preferences?
  
  Always include:
  - Smart next step options (3-4 max)
  - Auto mode option
  - Time estimates
  - Gentle pushback if something seems off
  - Ability to accept custom sequences
```

## Example Interactions

### **User: "Write a blog post about AI"**

**LLM Display**:
```
🎯 Goal: Write blog post about AI

📋 Smart Next Steps:
1. 🔍 **Research** - Gather current AI trends and data (researcher, 30min)
2. ✍️ **Start Writing** - Begin with outline and intro (writer, 45min)  
3. 🎨 **Plan Visuals** - Create supporting graphics strategy (designer, 15min)
4. 🤖 **Auto Mode** - Let me handle the full sequence

❓ **What feels right?** (or describe your own approach)
```

### **User picks "3" (visuals first)**

**LLM Intelligent Pushback**:
```
🤔 Interesting choice! Starting with visuals before content is unusual.

📝 **Gentle pushback**: Visuals typically work better when we know:
- The key points we're making
- Target audience reading level  
- Content structure and flow

💡 **Alternative approaches**:
1. **Quick strategy first** - 5min to define key points, then visuals
2. **Inspiration visuals** - Create mood boards to inspire writing
3. **Proceed anyway** - You might have a specific vision

**What's your thinking?**
```

### **User: "research, fact check, create visuals, proof read, then review"**

**LLM Auto-Execution**:
```
✅ **Full sequence planned**:

🔄 **Auto-executing your workflow**:
1. 🔍 Research AI trends → researcher (30min)
2. ✅ Fact check findings → fact_checker (15min)  
3. 🎨 Create supporting visuals → designer (45min)
4. 📝 Proofread content → editor (20min)
5. 👁️ Final review → you + senior_editor (10min)

⏱️ **Total time**: ~2 hours

🚀 **Starting research phase...** 
   (you can pause/redirect anytime with "stop" or new instructions)
```

### **User: "just write"**

**LLM Streamlined Response**:
```
✍️ **Direct to writing**

📝 **Writer agent activated**
- Starting with minimal research (using existing knowledge)
- Will flag gaps where research might be needed
- Can always pause to fact-check or add visuals later

🎯 **Writing approach**:
1. **Outline first** - Structure the key points  
2. **Draft directly** - Start writing from intro
3. **Stream of consciousness** - Brain dump then organize

**Pick your style** (or just say "go"):
```

### **Auto Mode Example**

**User**: "Create a technical blog post about Docker optimization"

**LLM Auto Analysis**:
```
🤖 **Auto Mode**: Technical Docker Optimization Post

📊 **Analysis**:
- Technical content = needs accuracy
- Optimization = needs current best practices  
- Blog post = needs engagement

🔄 **Generated Sequence**:
1. 🔍 Research current Docker best practices (researcher, 45min)
2. ✍️ Write technical outline + introduction (writer, 30min)
3. 💻 Create/test code examples (dev, 60min)  
4. ✅ Technical fact check (technical_reviewer, 20min)
5. 🎨 Add diagrams and visuals (designer, 30min)
6. 📝 Final polish and SEO (editor, 15min)

⏱️ **Total**: ~3.5 hours
🎯 **Confidence**: High (standard technical content workflow)

**Proceed with auto sequence?** [y/n/modify]
```

## Flexible Workflow Engine

```javascript
class FlexibleWorkflowEngine {
  async processRequest(request, workflowHints) {
    const analysis = await this.analyzeRequest(request);
    
    // LLM decides how to present options
    const presentation = await this.llm.generate({
      prompt: `
        User wants: ${request}
        
        Available agents: ${workflowHints.agents}
        Common patterns: ${workflowHints.steps}
        
        Provide 3-4 smart next step options.
        Include time estimates.
        Add gentle pushback if user choice seems suboptimal.
        Always include "auto mode" option.
        Be conversational and helpful.
      `,
      context: analysis
    });
    
    return presentation;
  }
  
  async handleUserChoice(choice, context) {
    if (choice === 'auto') {
      return this.generateAutoSequence(context);
    }
    
    if (choice.includes('then')) {
      // User described full sequence: "research, then write, then edit"
      return this.parseAndExecuteSequence(choice);
    }
    
    // Single step choice
    return this.executeSingleStep(choice, context);
  }
  
  generateAutoSequence(context) {
    // LLM analyzes context and creates optimal sequence
    return this.llm.generate({
      prompt: `
        Given this context: ${context}
        
        Create an optimal sequence of agents and steps.
        Consider:
        - Content type and complexity
        - Quality requirements
        - Time constraints
        - User's apparent expertise level
        
        Return a logical sequence with time estimates.
      `
    });
  }
}
```

## Key Benefits

### **1. Pure Flexibility**
- User can jump to any step at any time

- LLM creates optimal sequence based on context
- Can still be modified or interrupted

### **4. Natural Language**
- "research, then write, then edit" just works
- "skip research, just write" is understood
- "do everything except visuals" is parsed correctly

### **5. Context Awareness**
- Technical content gets different treatment
- User expertise level affects suggestions
- Previous choices influence future options
