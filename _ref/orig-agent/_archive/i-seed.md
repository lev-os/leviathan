# i-seed: Evolution Strategy & Implementation Planning

*Working document for the next phase of Kingly Agent evolution*

## üî¨ Analysis: What Happened

### Experiment Results
- **Self-building proven**: Seed ‚Üí Enhanced System (77.8% test pass rate)
- **Synthetic agent factory working**: Dynamic agent creation + promotion criteria
- **Multi-agent collaboration validated**: WRITE Method 90.4% accuracy
- **Fractal intelligence discovered**: Complex task decomposition
- **Meta-cognitive capability**: System can reason about itself

### Key Breakthroughs
- Minimal seed builds complex system
- Agent specialization > generalization
- Quality through collaboration patterns
- Autonomous synthetic agent promotion
- Self-healing missing method implementation

## üéØ What To Keep

### Core Architecture (Proven)
- [ ] **Seed philosophy**: Minimal system builds itself
- [ ] **Everything-is-an-agent**: Universal composability 
- [ ] **Synthetic agent factory**: On-demand specialization
- [ ] **Multi-agent workflows**: WRITE Method collaboration
- [ ] **Self-build capability**: Recursive improvement

### Specific Components (Audit Required)
- [ ] `enhanced-orchestrator.js` - Core routing + fractal intelligence
- [ ] `synthetic-agent-factory.js` - Dynamic agent creation
- [ ] `workspace-manager.js` - Context management
- [ ] `self-build.js` - Recursive improvement
- [ ] Agent roster (mini-ceo, mini-dev, content, design, marketing)

## üîç Code Audit: Other Projects

### agent-cli (CLI/LLM dual architecture)
- [ ] **What's there**: Orchestration patterns, command loading
- [ ] **What to port**: CLI interface patterns, capability bundling
- [ ] **Integration point**: CLI mode for kingly-agent

### agent-mcp (MCP server implementation)  
- [ ] **What's there**: MCP protocol, tool handlers, task lifecycle
- [ ] **What to port**: MCP integration, tool management
- [ ] **Integration point**: Universal MCP router

### claude-task-master (Task management)
- [ ] **What's there**: Task decomposition, dependency management
- [ ] **What to port**: Complex task handling patterns
- [ ] **Integration point**: Enhanced task splitting

## üìã Todo List Discussion

### High Priority
- [x] ~~Design Evolution Pipeline Framework~~ ‚úÖ *Complete*
- [ ] **Create Agent Lifecycle Management System** 
  - *Discussion*: How does synthetic ‚Üí permanent promotion work?
- [ ] **Create Evolution Quality Gates**
  - *Discussion*: What's minimum viable quality threshold?

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] **Implement Seed Generation Versioning**
  - *Discussion*: How do we handle rollbacks? Branching?
- [ ] **Build Agent Discovery & Packaging Registry**
  - *Discussion*: NPM packages? Docker? MCP servers?

## üé™ Bundling & Discovery Strategy

### Current State
- Seed system works but isn't packaged
- No discovery mechanism for new agents
- No versioning or rollback capability

### Key Questions
1. **Distribution**: How do users get/install agents?
2. **Discovery**: How do they find new capabilities?
3. **Packaging**: What format? NPM? Docker? MCP?
4. **Versioning**: How do we manage evolution generations?
5. **Integration**: IDE plugins? Web interface? CLI only?

## üöÄ Next Steps Framework

### Phase 1: Consolidation (This Session)
- [ ] Audit existing code across all projects
- [ ] Decide what to keep/port/discard
- [ ] Create unified architecture plan
- [ ] Define packaging strategy

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Next Session)
- [ ] Implement agent lifecycle management
- [ ] Build discovery/packaging system
- [ ] Create evolution quality gates
- [ ] Test enhanced self-build process

### Phase 3: Distribution (Future)
- [ ] Package for multiple deployment modes
- [ ] Create user interfaces (CLI, web, IDE)
- [ ] Build community/marketplace
- [ ] Scale infrastructure

## ü§î Key Decisions Needed

### Architecture Decisions
- **Single system vs modular**: Keep seed minimal or make it comprehensive?
- **Distribution strategy**: How do users consume this?
- **Integration approach**: Focus on CLI, MCP, or build all interfaces?

### Technical Decisions  
- **Code portability**: What patterns from agent-cli/agent-mcp are worth keeping?
- **Quality thresholds**: What's acceptable pass rate for evolution?
- **Rollback strategy**: How do we handle failed evolutions?

### Business Decisions
- **Target audience**: Developers? Business users? Both?
- **Deployment models**: Self-hosted? SaaS? Hybrid?
- **Monetization**: Open source? Freemium? Enterprise?
