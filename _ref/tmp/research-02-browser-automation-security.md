# Research #2: Browser Automation & Secure Credential Management

## Key Technologies

**Browser MCP Tools:**
- Chrome's Federated Credential Management (FedCM) API
- Digital Credentials API - browser-to-wallet bridge
- Playwright/Selenium integration with credential managers
- Browser extensions for credential injection

**Banking/Financial Automation:**
- StrongDM - Fine-grained access control and auditing
- Bitwarden API/CLI integration
- Device fingerprinting bypass strategies
- MFA handling for automation

**Tax Platform Integration:**
- Runtime credential fetching (never hardcoded)
- Passkey/digital credential support
- Session/cookie management for multi-step flows
- AI-driven form filling with secure auth

**Social Media Automation:**
- Dedicated password manager integration
- Browser-native passkey support
- Bot detection mitigation
- Federated identity when available

## Security Framework

| Component | Best Practice | Risk Mitigation |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Credentials | End-to-end encrypted managers | No plaintext/script storage |
| Sessions | Device-bound, ephemeral tokens | Reduced cookie theft risk |
| Access | Role-based control (RBAC) | Restricted agent permissions |
| Auditing | Centralized logging | Full credential usage tracking |

## Integration Solutions

- **Bitwarden**: API/CLI with E2E encryption, MFA, RBAC
- **Chrome Identity APIs**: Native passkeys, device binding
- **StrongDM**: Session management, temporary access
- **Digital Credentials API**: Wallet-to-browser flow

## Recommendations
1. Never store credentials in automation scripts
2. Use runtime credential fetching from secure managers
3. Implement device-bound session management
4. Deploy comprehensive audit logging
5. Leverage native browser identity APIs when possible
