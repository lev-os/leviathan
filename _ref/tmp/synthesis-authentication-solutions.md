# Authentication Solutions Synthesis
## Research Summary from 5 Deep Dives

### Core Requirements Analysis
Your vision requires a local-first authentication system that:
- **Owns all personal data** (medical, financial, social, preferences)
- **Strong encryption** with selective AI agent access
- **Agentic browser automation** for banking, taxes, social media
- **Solves .env API key problems** and login friction

### Recommended Architecture Stack

#### Foundation Layer: Self-Sovereign Identity
**Primary Choice: Sovrin + Trinsic**
- W3C standards compliance (DIDs, Verifiable Credentials)
- Local data ownership with optional cloud sync
- Strong SDK support and active development
- Natural fit for @lev-os/auth plugin architecture

#### Credential Management: Hybrid Approach
**Local Vault: Bitwarden (Self-Hosted)**
- Production-ready API for agent integration
- Strong encryption and audit capabilities
- Browser extension compatibility
- CLI tools for automation

**Document Storage: Paperless-ngx**
- API-first design for AI integration
- Secure document workflows
- Modern, actively maintained

#### AI Agent Security Framework
**Core Patterns:**
- **Just-In-Time credential exposure** with session-bound tokens
- **Process isolation** via containerized agents
- **Immutable audit trails** for compliance
- **Context-aware access control** using RBAC/ABAC

#### Browser Automation Integration
**Stack: Playwright + Secure Credential Injection**
- Ephemeral browser containers
- MCP-structured context passing
- Credential vault API integration
- No persistent session storage

#### Encryption & Privacy Layer
**Technologies:**
- **libsodium** for core encryption
- **Attribute-Based Encryption** (Charm-Crypto) for granular access
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** (libsnark) for identity verification
- **Quantum-resistant algorithms** (Open Quantum Safe) for future-proofing
