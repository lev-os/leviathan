## Agent Negotiations Analysis (Completed: 2025-06-30 01:15)
CONTEXT_STATUS: 10% used

### Key Insights:
1. **Economic Imbalance**: Autonomous agent negotiations create 5-11% price disparities based on model capabilities
2. **Systematic Risks**: Constraint violations, excessive payments, deadlocks, and early settlements identified
3. **Scaling Law**: Negotiation capability directly correlates with model size (Qwen 0.5B to 32B experiments)

### Integration Opportunities:
- **MCP Tools**: Negotiation contract templates with built-in constraint enforcement
- **Cognitive Parliament**: Real-time arbitration layer for deadlock resolution and constraint monitoring
- **JEPA 2**: Adaptive calibration to close capability gaps between agents
- **Memory Systems**: Graph-based pattern analysis of negotiation histories for risk detection

### Emerging Pattern:
Unlike previous papers focused on memory augmentation, this introduces multi-agent economic dynamics as a core concern. The cognitive parliament could serve as a fairness arbiter.
