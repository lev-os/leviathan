**A** **BSTRACT**

With the rapid penetration of artificial intelligence across industries and scenarios, a key challenge in
building the next-generation intelligent core lies in effectively integrating the language understanding
capabilities of foundation models with domain-specific knowledge bases in complex real-world
applications. This paper proposes a multimodal cognition and embodied decision-making brain
system, “Wenlu", designed to enable secure fusion of private knowledge and public models, unified
processing of multimodal data such as images and speech, and closed-loop decision-making from
cognition to automatic generation of hardware-level code. The system introduces a brain-inspired
memory tagging and replay mechanism, seamlessly integrating user-private data, industry-specific
knowledge, and general-purpose language models. It provides precise and efficient multimodal
services for enterprise decision support, medical analysis, autonomous driving, robotic control,
and more. Compared with existing solutions, “Wenlu" demonstrates significant advantages in
multimodal processing, privacy security, end-to-end hardware control code generation, self-learning,
and sustainable updates, thus laying a solid foundation for constructing the next-generation intelligent

core.

**1** **Introduction**

Amid the continuous evolution of artificial intelligence, large-scale language models (LLMs) driven by deep learning
have become a cornerstone in the construction of intelligent systems. However, most mainstream language models
today remain predominantly focused on unimodal text-based input-output paradigms, exhibiting limited capabilities
in handling multimodal data. Simultaneously, a persistent challenge for both academia and industry lies in how to
efficiently integrate domain-specific knowledge with general-purpose models while ensuring the protection of user
privacy. To address this gap and advance the deployment of next-generation intelligent applications, this paper proposes
an embodied brain system named “Wenlu", designed to establish a complete closed loop from multimodal cognition
to automatic hardware code generation. The system demonstrates a secure and efficient compatibility in scenarios
involving private data and domain knowledge, thereby offering a robust foundation for the intelligent integration of
large models into real-world tasks.

In recent years, the challenges facing intelligent decision-making and multimodal information processing have primarily
arisen from the following aspects: First, different types of data-such as text, images, speech, and sensor readings-differ
significantly in dimensionality, feature distributions, and temporal characteristics, making it difficult to efficiently
integrate them using a single network architecture or a general-purpose model. Second, deep domain knowledge is often

A “Wenlu" Brain System for Multimodal Cognition and Embodied Decision-Making

embedded within private or proprietary datasets, requiring more rigorous security and compliance measures. However,
foundation models are typically trained on massive open-source data and lack built-in mechanisms for confidentiality
and access control, which hinders their direct application in sensitive or regulated fields. Third, many current AI
systems remain at the stage of “perception–cognition" and are unable to automatically translate intelligent decisions
into executable processes such as machine control or code generation. This limitation has become a major barrier to the
effective deployment of AI in embodied scenarios such as robotics, wearable devices, and autonomous driving.

To effectively address these challenges, the “Wenlu" system proposes a multi-layered architectural design that tightly
integrates a user-private data decision module, an industry-oriented multimodal decision and service module, a hardware
control and automated code generation module, and a foundation model fusion unit. The private knowledge unit ensures
secure isolation and controllable access to sensitive user information through encrypted sandboxes and labeled data
management. The multimodal decision module enables the system to go beyond text processing and perform integrated
analysis and reasoning over diverse data sources such as images, speech, and sensor inputs. The hardware control
module further bridges the gap between language understanding and physical execution, automatically generating
control instructions from high-level cognition or task descriptions to realize real-time feedback and actions on robots
or other devices. At the core, the foundation model fusion unit handles comprehensive language understanding and
generation, offering robust semantic support to all upper-layer modules, while being deeply coupled with both private
knowledge bases and domain-specific datasets.

In addition, drawing inspiration from the biological brain’s mechanisms of memory tagging and replay, the “Wenlu"
system incorporates a brain-inspired memory reinforcement architecture. When executing complex decision-making
tasks, the system automatically tags key information and critical reasoning pathways. These tagged memories are
subsequently replayed and reinforced during idle or offline phases, enabling continual optimization of multimodal
understanding and reasoning capabilities. This brain-like memory mechanism not only enhances the system’s deep
cognition and reuse capacity in specific scenarios but also lays a solid foundation for self-learning and continuous
iteration.

At the application level, the “Wenlu" embodied brain system is designed to meet the demands of diverse industries and
scenarios, including automated inspection and control in industrial manufacturing, diagnostic assistance in medical
imaging, environmental perception in autonomous driving, human–robot interaction in service robotics, and intelligent
monitoring in wearable devices. By integrating domain expertise with general semantic understanding, “Wenlu" offers
specialized decision support and automated execution solutions while ensuring data security and privacy compliance.
Compared with traditional systems that rely on manual configuration or plug-in invocation, it significantly reduces
communication costs and error rates, and achieves self-learning and self-adaptation through continuous iteration.

In summary, the “Wenlu" system aims to serve as a general-purpose platform for multimodal cognition and embodied
decision-making. It inherits the strengths of large language models in textual understanding and generation, while
significantly enhancing its capabilities in processing images, audio, sensor data, and other modalities. It enables the
secure use of private information and facilitates deep coupling with domain-specific knowledge across various industrial
scenarios. Moreover, it translates intelligent decision outcomes into executable hardware control code, achieving a truly
integrated closed loop of “perception–cognition–decision–action". This paper systematically presents the technical
framework of the “Wenlu" embodied brain, focusing on multimodal integration, private information management,
automatic code generation, and brain-inspired memory reinforcement. It also provides an in-depth discussion of its
potential value across different industries and application domains. Through this architectural design, we aim to offer a
novel pathway for transitioning artificial intelligence from academic research to industrial deployment, and to lay a
viable technological foundation for the construction of next-generation general intelligent cores.

**2** **Theoretical Background and Limitations of Existing Technologies**

Over the past decade, artificial intelligence has developed rapidly, evolving from early models based on statistical
learning to deep learning, large-scale language models, and multimodal fusion technologies. Especially in the field
of natural language processing (NLP), the emergence of general-purpose language models (Large Language Models,
LLMs) based on the Transformer architecture has sparked widespread discussion about the potential of “artificial
general intelligence." However, current mainstream technical systems still face numerous challenges in multimodal
information integration, private data security, automated code generation, and deep coupling of domain knowledge. To
analyze these issues in depth, the following will discuss the existing technical background and limitations in the context
of several typical solutions.

2

A “Wenlu" Brain System for Multimodal Cognition and Embodied Decision-Making

**2.1** **Challenges in Multimodal Fusion and Cognitive Decision-Making**

Early applications of artificial intelligence primarily focused on single modalities, such as image recognition, speech
recognition, and text generation. However, information in the real world is often multimodal-images, audio, text, and
sensor data frequently coexist and interrelate. In this context, multimodal fusion technologies have emerged, aiming to
improve perception and decision-making accuracy by establishing unified feature spaces or semantic representations
across different modalities.

Although existing multimodal technologies have achieved preliminary success in tasks such as image-text matching and
visual question answering, they remain inadequate in deep cognition and complex decision-making, primarily due to
the following reasons:

1. Difficulty in Feature Alignment and Semantic Projection
The data dimensions and semantic distributions of different modalities vary significantly, necessitating a
unified network architecture or feature projection mechanism. Improper alignment among modalities can
severely limit the model’s reasoning effectiveness.

2. Lack of Cross-Modal Long-Term Memory and Reasoning Framework
Most multimodal fusion research focuses on short-term or one-off reasoning, unable to support long-duration,
multi-step cognitive processes. For example, industrial inspection or medical diagnosis often requires continuous temporal information and iterative judgment, posing higher demands on multimodal systems.

3. Insufficient Model Interpretability and Causal Reasoning
Multimodal models typically rely on large-scale training data for pattern matching and have yet to develop an
understanding of “common sense" or “causal" relationships in the real world. The absence of interpretability
mechanisms during industry deployment affects user trust and decision safety.

**2.2** **Limitations of Foundation Models and Bottlenecks in Industry Knowledge Integration**

Since the advent of the Transformer and its improved variants, foundation language models trained on massive public
corpora-such as the GPT and BERT families-have made breakthroughs in language understanding and generation.
However, directly applying these large models to specific industries or private data scenarios encounters several
challenges:

1. Lack of Industry-Specific Knowledge
Foundation models are trained on broad datasets covering diverse domains but have limited deep mastery
of any specific field. In rigorous professional scenarios such as medical diagnosis or financial analysis, the
absence of in-depth domain knowledge significantly reduces the accuracy and reliability of model outputs.

2. Privacy and Compliance Challenges
Foundation models are often open in nature, lacking strict security isolation in their training data and inference
pathways. Mixing users’ private information with public corpora easily leads to data leakage or misuse.
Increasingly stringent regulatory requirements on data compliance and user privacy make the secure integration
of private data with large models an urgent problem to solve.

3. Lack of Continual Learning and Memory Mechanisms
Although current large models have vast parameter scales, their “memory" mainly resides in trained weights,
which lack flexibility. Absorbing new knowledge during operation typically involves costly “fine-tuning" or
even “large-scale retraining," hindering rapid iteration and knowledge accumulation.

4. “Breakpoint" from Abstract Understanding to Concrete Execution
Even if a large model can generate accurate textual descriptions, it is difficult to directly convert them into
automatically executable hardware commands or robot control scripts. This gap prevents foundation models
from fully realizing end-to-end intelligence in embodied scenarios.

**2.3** **Traditional Approaches to Robotics and Hardware Control and Their Drawbacks**

In the field of robotics and hardware control, mainstream development approaches typically require human engineers
to manually program action strategies and control logic, translating natural language requirements into low-level
commands or API calls. This process has multiple limitations:

1. High Costs of Manual Programming and Interface Adaptation

3

A “Wenlu" Brain System for Multimodal Cognition and Embodied Decision-Making

Each robotic platform or wearable device has its specific APIs or SDKs. Porting and adapting these require
engineers to spend significant time writing code and debugging, resulting in lengthy development cycles and
high susceptibility to errors.

2. Insufficient Adaptability to Dynamic External Environments
When the physical environment changes or hardware is updated, substantial program modifications are needed,
making it difficult to achieve a dynamic, self-adaptive closed-loop system.

3. Difficulty Integrating with High-Level Semantic Reasoning
Robotic control often remains limited to sensor data processing and behavior planning, lacking deep understanding of high-level information such as natural language or domain knowledge, and is unable to be unified
with multimodal decision-making systems.

**2.4** **Compromise Solutions of Plugin-Based / External API Integration and Their Issues**

To bridge the gap between foundation models and domain-specific applications, some technical practices attempt to
augment large models with plugins or external API calls. For example, encapsulating robot APIs or wearable device
interfaces as plugins and providing corresponding invocation examples to the language model for extension. While
such methods endow foundation models with certain hardware interaction capabilities, they still exhibit the following
shortcomings in practical applications:

1. Lack of Context Management
Plugin-based approaches inherently rely on temporary API calls and lack a unified memory and reasoning
management system, resulting in limited context continuity for large models during multi-turn conversations
or cross-modal scenarios.

2. Complex Cross-Domain Invocation Chains
When a task requires multiple plugins to collaborate simultaneously (e.g., reading sensor data, controlling a
robotic arm, and generating diagnostic reports), the plugin invocation chain becomes cumbersome and highly
coupled, leading to high maintenance costs.

3. Unstable Decision Outcomes

Instability in plugin interfaces and invocation timing often causes unexpected system failures or errors. Once
an anomaly occurs, the large model itself lacks global awareness of the hardware or external APIs, making
self-correction difficult.

**2.5** **Knowledge Graph-Based Question Answering and Decision-Making Systems**

In specific industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, knowledge graph-based question answering and
reasoning systems have also been developed. These systems encapsulate structured expert knowledge into searchable
graph nodes and edge relationships to assist inference and decision-making. However, such approaches face several
constraints:

1. High Construction and Maintenance Costs
Knowledge graphs require dedicated teams for data annotation, updating, and maintenance. Moreover,
multimodal features (such as images, audio, and sensor data) are difficult to represent efficiently within the
graph.

2. Lack of Strong Support for Language Generation
Compared with general large models, traditional knowledge graphs mainly focus on retrieval-based question
answering or logical reasoning, lacking natural language understanding and generation capabilities, and are
insufficient in presenting complex domain data in a readable format.

3. Inability to Achieve Automated Hardware Output
Knowledge graph-based systems primarily emphasize “information retrieval" and “logical reasoning", and
remain far from automatically generating robot or device control commands, making it difficult to form an
embodied closed-loop system.

**2.6** **Overview and Limitations Analysis**

Combining the above-mentioned typical approaches, it can be summarized that existing technologies exhibit significant
limitations in the following aspects:

4

A “Wenlu" Brain System for Multimodal Cognition and Embodied Decision-Making

1. Insufficient Multimodal Fusion
Whether relying on general large models or knowledge graphs, the vast majority of existing systems lack the
capability to simultaneously process multimodal information such as images, audio, text, and sensor data for
deep decision-making, or can only achieve limited functional integration through plugin-based methods.

2. Lack of Secure and Controllable Private Data Management
Most current large models overlook privacy protection requirements, while traditional industry systems often
lack support for open language understanding; efficient and secure integration between the two remains
challenging.

3. “Break" Between Cognition and Execution
General large models can perform text understanding and generation, but still require manual “translation" for
physical hardware control, resulting in a disconnect between actual decision-making and execution, which
impedes self-learning and rapid iteration.

4. Lack of Continuous Self-learning and Memory Reinforcement Mechanisms
Whether large models or knowledge graphs, updates and fine-tuning usually incur high costs. Most solutions
lack brain-inspired memory tagging and replay mechanisms, making it difficult to accumulate new experience
and knowledge through continuous interaction and application.

Therefore, to break through the comprehensive barriers of multimodal cognition, private information protection, and
embodied decision-making, a novel architecture is needed that combines general language understanding, efficient
domain knowledge integration, secure private data protection, and automated hardware code generation capabilities. It
is under this background and driven by such demands that the “Wenlu" embodied brain system emerges, dedicated to
constructing an intelligent core for multimodal cognitive decision-making, emphasizing private information security,
and capable of directly outputting executable commands, thereby forming a complete closed loop of “PerceptionCognition-Decision-Execution".

**3** **Architecture of the “Wenlu" System**

The “Wenlu" Embodied Brain system aims to bridge the critical gaps in AI spanning multimodal cognition, private
information protection, and hardware control execution, thereby delivering more comprehensive, flexible, and secure
intelligent services for practical scenarios. To achieve this goal, “Wenlu" adopts a multi-layered, modular architecture
that includes not only the front-end for external perception and interaction but also a core backend deeply integrating
large models with private knowledge bases; simultaneously, it reserves modules for hardware control generation and
domain knowledge integration to meet end-to-end application requirements.

The first layer is the User Private Knowledge Understanding and Q & A Decision Unit, primarily addressing how
sensitive user information and domain-specific proprietary data can be securely utilized within large models. This
module employs technologies such as secure sandboxes, encrypted storage, and labeled management to ensure strict
control over read/write permissions for private data entering the system. When a user query involves sensitive content,
the system automatically invokes designated access policies to parse and desensitize the required private data. This unit
not only effectively isolates public training data from user private data but also provides highly customized support for
subsequent decision-making.

The second layer is the Industry Multimodal Decision and Service Support Unit, whose core function lies in integrating
industry-specific multimodal inputs such as images, voice, text, and sensor data with general large models at the
semantic level. By converting low-level processing of image recognition, audio analysis, and text understanding into
unified feature vectors or embedding representations, this module can comprehensively evaluate the correlations among
multisource signals and make deep decisions. In demanding fields like industrial inspection, medical imaging analysis,
or autonomous driving monitoring, this multimodal decision unit significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of
results and outputs richer interpretable analysis reports.

The third layer is the Robot Control and Hardware Device Code Generation Unit, acting as the bridge from cognition
to action within the entire “Wenlu" architecture. After the multimodal decision unit and private knowledge decision
unit collaboratively produce a confirmed execution plan, the robot control unit can automatically generate low-level
code scripts from high-level semantic instructions, adapting to various hardware platforms such as ROS2, wearable
device APIs, and intelligent robotic arm interfaces. Through this end-to-end automation, the system forms an integrated
closed-loop from natural language description and image/sensor fusion analysis to concrete device execution. Unlike
traditional manual programming, “Wenlu" achieves rapid migration upon hardware or environment changes by simply
updating the adaptation layer, greatly reducing engineering costs.

A “Wenlu" Brain System for Multimodal Cognition and Embodied Decision-Making

Supporting the entire system at the foundation is the Deep Language Model Base and “General-to-Specialized" Knowledge Fusion Unit. This unit comprises general large models (e.g., DeepSeek) with universal language understanding
and generation capabilities, alongside integrated expert domain knowledge bases to enhance Q & A and reasoning
accuracy in vertical fields. Additionally, this unit embeds a brain-like memory tagging and replay mechanism: during
each interaction or inference, the system automatically annotates key decisions or critical scenarios and replays and
reinforces them during idle or offline periods. This consolidates “long-term memory" for high-value knowledge and
frequent tasks. Such brain-inspired memory consolidation markedly improves system reliability and customization over
repeated interactions and offers both theoretical and technical guarantees for integrating large models with private data
and domain knowledge.

It is important to emphasize that these units are not isolated components but collaborate efficiently through a unified bus
and communication protocol: the private knowledge decision unit shares core model capabilities with the multimodal
decision unit and accesses encrypted data based on permission policies; multimodal analysis results are directly passed
to the hardware control generation unit to produce executable scripts or instructions; the foundational general model
and domain knowledge bases iteratively incorporate distilled content from repeated interactions via memory tagging to
provide increasingly accurate support for Q & A and decision-making.

Through this layered, modular architecture, “Wenlu" establishes a closed-loop system connecting multimodal perception,
semantic decision-making, private data processing, and robot control, offering a powerful and flexible solution for
intelligent applications across industries. Within this framework, the system not only performs deep reasoning
over multisource data in complex environments but also outputs automated hardware execution scripts while fully
safeguarding user sensitive information. Ultimately, “Wenlu" is poised to become the next-generation general intelligent
core, combining cross-industry scalability with personalized domain expertise, thereby providing robust technical
support for transitioning AI from laboratories to real-world production and life scenarios.

**4** **Core Modules and Implementation Mechanisms**

Within the “Wenlu" Embodied Brain architecture, each module is designed around the principles of multimodal fusion,
privacy protection, and an end-to-end decision-making closed loop. To clearly present the technical concepts and
internal logic, this section provides an academic and structured exposition of the four core modules, detailing their
structures, mechanisms, and inter-module collaboration according to system functionality and implementation flow.

each confidential piece of information.

2. Permission Verification and Desensitized Output

       - When a user query involves data flagged by security labels, the permission verification module is triggered
first to determine if access is allowed or if desensitization procedures must be executed.

       - Upon authorization, the private knowledge unit decrypts the original data and converts it into semantic
vectors; after merging with the inference results from the general model, a secondary review and sensitive
information filtering is performed.

3. Collaboration Between Private Knowledge and General Large Model

       - Employs encrypted indexing to embed private corpora within the implicit feature space shared by the
general model, enabling dynamic retrieval of relevant confidential information during inference.

       - The final Q & A or decision output undergoes security policy checks before release to ensure no
unauthorized leakage of sensitive information.

**4.2** **Industry Multimodal Decision-Making and Service Support Unit**

**4.2.1** **Module Functionality**

The “Wenlu" multimodal decision-making unit aims to organically integrate various types of industry data (such as
images, audio, text, sensor signals) and, supported by industry-specific knowledge bases and general language models,
output more refined and interpretable decision results. Its main functions include:

1. Unified feature extraction and embedding representation of diverse input modalities.

2. Context understanding and situational awareness through semantic fusion of multimodal information by large
models.

3. Deep judgment and service output tailored to specific industry scenarios (e.g., medical diagnosis, industrial
inspection).

A “Wenlu" Brain System for Multimodal Cognition and Embodied Decision-Making

**4.2.2** **Technical Implementation Mechanisms**

1. Feature Fusion and Semantic Projection

       - For data types including images, audio, and sensors, specialized deep neural networks are employed to
extract feature vectors; these are then projected and fused with textual inputs within a unified semantic

space.

       - Contextual information across modalities is interconnected using mechanisms such as Multi-Head
Attention or Cross-Modal Transformers, generating a comprehensive multimodal representation.

2. Interaction Between Industry Knowledge Base and General Models

       - Based on the fused representation, the system invokes both the general language model and domainspecific knowledge bases for inference. When private data is involved, label matching with the private
knowledge unit is also performed.

       - The process culminates in interpretable industry-specific outputs such as diagnostic reports, fault detection,
predictive analyses, or service plans.

3. Explainability and Service Interfaces

       - To support high-reliability applications in sectors like industry and healthcare, the system integrates
explainability components that provide core evidence alongside decision conclusions (e.g., annotated
defect regions, semantic key points).

       - The final results can be delivered via APIs or front-end interfaces for user reference or further interaction.

**4.3** **Robot Control and Hardware Code Generation Unit**

**4.3.1** **Module Functionality**

This unit is the key component of the “Wenlu" system for embodied decision-making. It enables the automatic translation
from high-level semantic understanding to executable hardware control instructions, providing direct execution plans
for physical platforms such as robots and wearable devices. Its main functions include:

1. Generating corresponding executable scripts or API call instructions based on task descriptions output by the
general language model or the multimodal decision unit.

2. Adapting to various robotic operating systems (e.g., ROS2) and other hardware device driver layers, while
managing real-time feedback and dynamic environmental adjustments.

3. Establishing a closed loop from perception to cognition to action, thereby reducing manual programming
effort and interface mapping costs.

**4.3.2** **Technical Implementation Mechanisms**

1. Mapping from High-Level Semantics to Commands

       - Leveraging the sequence-to-sequence generation capabilities of language models, this module converts
natural language requirements or multimodal reasoning outputs into hardware control languages such as
ROS2 node scripts, embedded C++, or Python execution scripts.

       - During the output stage, the generated code can either be compiled or interpreted to meet the specifications
of different operating environments.

2. Adaptation Layer and Interface Management

       - A unified adaptation layer is designed for mainstream robotic frameworks and hardware platforms.
This layer translates intermediate instructions generated by the general model into function calls or
configuration files that conform to specific APIs, facilitating rapid hardware switching.

       - When hardware or environmental configurations change, engineers only need to modify the adaptation
layer, without the need for large-scale adjustments to high-level logic.

3. Real-Time Feedback and Closed-Loop Iteration

       - Status data or sensor feedback generated during hardware execution can be fed back into the multimodal
decision unit for subsequent decision updates, enabling adaptivity and self-learning.

       - Through continuous iteration, the system can better adapt to complex or dynamic external environments.

**4.4** **Deep Language Model Foundation and “General–Domain-Specific Integration" Knowledge Fusion Module**

**4.4.1** **Module Functionality**

This unit forms the foundational support of the entire “Wenlu" system, integrating open-source or commercial generalpurpose large language models (e.g., DeepSeek) with industry-specific knowledge bases through a “general–domainspecific" fusion approach. It is responsible not only for cross-domain language understanding and generation, but also
for providing a unified semantic foundation for reasoning over multimodal and private data.

**4.4.2** **Technical Implementation Mechanisms**

1. Pre-trained Model Deployment and Integration with Domain Knowledge Bases

       - The system deploys pre-trained general large models on local servers or cloud platforms and incorporates
domain expert knowledge bases into the shared semantic space through fine-tuning or incremental
training.

       - In response to varying domain demands, the system can dynamically load corresponding sub-knowledge
bases to enable more targeted domain-specific reasoning capabilities.

2. Neuro-Inspired Memory Tagging and Replay

       - Inspired by biological memory tagging and replay mechanisms, the system marks important scenarios or
reasoning paths each time it completes a complex decision-making or service task.

       - During idle or offline periods, it replays and reinforces the tagged information, achieving secondary
consolidation of potentially high-value knowledge and gradually improving prediction accuracy and
execution efficiency for similar tasks.

3. Multi-Module Collaboration and Adaptive Updating

       - The private knowledge module, multimodal decision module, and hardware control module all communicate bidirectionally with the model foundation to access general language capabilities or update internal
knowledge indices.

       - When new domain-specific data or private information is received, the system uses encrypted indexing and
incremental fusion strategies to gradually embed such knowledge into the model architecture, enhancing
its deep reasoning and customized service capabilities.

**4.5** **Inter-Module Collaboration and Overall Workflow**

In practical operation, “Wenlu" forms a closed-loop system by integrating the above four core modules through a unified
interface bus and communication protocol. The overall workflow is illustrated as follows:

1. Reception of External Multimodal Data and User Requests: The multimodal decision-making unit performs
feature extraction or semantic alignment on incoming multimodal data (e.g., images, speech, text, sensor
signals) and user queries. If private data is involved, the system invokes the private knowledge unit for secure
handling.

2. Core Language Model Inference and Memory Tagging: The general model fusion unit accesses the foundational
language model and domain-specific knowledge bases to conduct deep analysis on multimodal inputs, while
simultaneously tagging critical decision paths or scenarios for memory replay and reinforcement.

3. Secure Processing of Private Information: If the reasoning process or output involves sensitive data, the private
knowledge unit is triggered to carry out sandboxed decryption, permission verification, and necessary data
desensitization before further usage or output.

4. Decision Output and Hardware Control: Once a high-level decision is made, the robot control and code
generation unit translates it into executable scripts or API calls, which are dispatched to the target hardware,
such as robots or embedded systems.

5. Execution Feedback and Self-Adaptation: Feedback from devices or the external environment is fed back
into the multimodal and core language modules, initiating memory replay and reinforcement learning to
continuously optimize the overall performance of the “Wenlu" system.

Through this modular and scalable architecture, “Wenlu" flexibly supports the full spectrum from software-level question
answering to hardware-level execution, achieving truly multimodal cognition and embodied artificial intelligence. Each
module complements the others: it ensures the security of private data while also delivering deep decision-making
support and automatic execution across diverse industry scenarios.

**5** **System Innovations and Technical Advantages**

Building upon the deep integration of multimodal fusion, large-scale language model semantic understanding, and
secure privacy protection, the “Wenlu" embodied brain system establishes a relatively complete and closed-loop
architecture for AI innovation. The following elaborates on its key innovations and technical advantages from three
dimensions: technology, application, and ecosystem.

**5.1** **Technological Innovations**

1. Multimodal Brain-Inspired Memory Tagging and Replay Mechanism
Unlike traditional systems that rely solely on the powerful reasoning and generation capabilities of generalpurpose large language models (LLMs) in the textual domain, “Wenlu" introduces a biologically inspired
“memory reinforcement" mechanism:

       - It tags key decision pathways from multimodal data-including text, images, audio, and sensor informationand replays them during system idle or offline phases for consolidation.

       - Through this mechanism, the system accumulates domain-specific experiential knowledge over time,
gradually improving its comprehension and reasoning accuracy in complex scenarios.

2. Deep Integration and Secure Management of Private Data
To address the prevalent privacy and compliance demands in industry applications, “Wenlu" incorporates a
dedicated private knowledge decision unit and encrypted sandbox architecture:

       - Confidential user information is stored and managed in isolation from public general-purpose corpora
through encryption and labeling, eliminating the risk of data leakage between private and public datasets.

       - During inference, any invocation of sensitive data is preceded by strict permission checks and desensitization procedures, ensuring tightly controlled exposure and minimizing security risks.

3. Embodied Closed-Loop from Cognition to Code Generation
Conventional AI systems often remain at the “cognition-to-decision" level, requiring manual implementation
of control logic to achieve physical execution. In contrast:

       - “Wenlu" integrates a built-in module for robot control and hardware code generation, automatically
translating high-level decisions into executable hardware instructions or scripts.

       - This eliminates the need for repeated manual translation, significantly reducing labor costs and development cycles, while enabling rapid adaptation to changing environments.

4. Deep Coupling of General-Purpose LLMs with Domain Knowledge
To bridge the gap between industry-specific data and open-domain large models, “Wenlu" adopts a “generalto-specific" integration strategy within its general model fusion unit:

       - Through lightweight fine-tuning or incremental training, domain-specific knowledge is organically
embedded into the semantic space of general-purpose language models.

       - When applied to vertical industry scenarios, the model can leverage both general and specialized knowledge, producing more precise question answering and complex reasoning outcomes.

**5.2** **Technical Advantages and Application Value**

1. Unified Multimodal Processing
The system is capable of handling text, images, audio, and various types of sensor data simultaneously,
integrating multimodal inputs into a unified semantic space. This enables higher precision and stronger
interpretability in decision-making for scenarios requiring the coordination of diverse information sources,
such as industrial inspection, medical diagnosis, and autonomous driving.

2. Secure and Controllable Private Data Management
“Wenlu" establishes a robust security framework for handling sensitive user information through an independent
private knowledge decision module and a tagging-based encryption strategy. This approach strikes a balance
between the value of data utilization and compliance risk, while also providing a feasible path for enterpriselevel private deployment of large language models.

3. End-to-End Embodied Code Generation

and detailing key implementation points.

13

A “Wenlu" Brain System for Multimodal Cognition and Embodied Decision-Making

**7.1** **Initialization and Model Loading**

1. General Model Deployment

       - Deploy open-source or commercial large-scale language models (e.g., DeepSeek) in cloud or local server
environments, with appropriate computing resources provisioned (GPU/TPU).

       - Perform necessary fine-tuning or incremental training based on the target industry requirements to
improve the model’s accuracy in question-answering and reasoning within specific domain scenarios.

2. Industry Knowledge Base and Private Data Management Module Preparation

       - Import or build industry-specific knowledge bases (such as medical, manufacturing, finance) to provide
robust data support for multimodal decision-making and reasoning.

       - Configure the private knowledge decision unit to encrypt, label, and index materials that may contain
sensitive information (texts, tables, images, confidential documents, etc.).

       - Establish access control policies, including role-based permissions and desensitization output mechanisms,
ensuring private data is stored securely and separately from public training corpora.

3. Multimodal Input Channel Construction

       - Interface with image capture devices, voice acquisition, sensor data reading, etc., to achieve real-time
connection or periodic data retrieval from external devices/databases.

       - For scenarios requiring physical interaction (e.g., robots, wearable devices), initialize communication
protocols or adaptation layers to ensure smooth command sending and receiving post-deployment.

**7.2** **Encrypted Access and Tagging of Private Data**

1. Private Data Upload and Identification

       - Users or system administrators upload private files via the backend (e.g., internal corporate documents,
medical records, confidential technical plans), which are automatically encrypted by the system and
assigned a unique identifier.

       - Through text analysis or predefined metadata, the system performs an initial semantic parsing of the file
contents, generating tags for sensitivity level, associated topics, and access permissions.

2. Permission Management and Indexing

       - Based on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) strategies, each private data item is assigned an access
level (e.g., visible only to administrators or specific business units).

       - A private index table is constructed within the system, embedding document content as vectors or
keywords and linking them to the general model for subsequent use in question-answering or inference.

3. Encrypted Storage and Sandbox Isolation

       - A secure sandbox mechanism is employed to store private data separately from public corpora, and
encryption algorithms (symmetric or asymmetric) are used to protect the files.

       - When external applications initiate requests involving private information, they must first pass an authorization and verification process before they can read or write sensitive content.

**7.3** **Multimodal Data Fusion and Preprocessing**

1. Feature Extraction Module

       - For image data, convolutional neural networks or other vision models are used for object detection,
classification, or feature embedding. For audio data, acoustic feature extraction or speech recognition
models are employed. Sensor data is processed through filtering, normalization, and other techniques.

       - Raw information from different modalities is transformed into unified or alignable vector representations
and stored in an intermediate buffer.

2. Semantic Fusion and Contextual Encoding

       - Leveraging the multimodal decision unit within the “Wenlu" system, feature vectors from images, speech,
text, and other modalities are integrated into a shared contextual encoding model. Attention mechanisms
are applied to learn semantic associations across modalities.

       - When needed, the system can dynamically access the domain-specific knowledge base to identify
professional knowledge points embedded in features (e.g., lesion locations in medical images or fault
points in industrial inspection data).

14

A “Wenlu" Brain System for Multimodal Cognition and Embodied Decision-Making

3. Privacy Detection and Filtering

       - If any multimodal data contains content that may be mapped to private indices (e.g., internal identifiers,
confidential parameters), a privacy identification check is first performed. If triggered, the system
coordinates with the private knowledge module to verify access rights before determining the next steps.

       - Content without sensitive markings is directly passed to the general model for deep semantic parsing and
reasoning.

**7.4** **Question Answering and Decision-Making Inference Workflow**

1. User Requests / Task Inputs

       - Users may initiate queries or decision-making requests via natural language, multimodal inputs (textimage combinations), or voice commands. Tasks can also be triggered by external events, such as
industrial equipment failure alerts or urgent medical diagnostic needs.

       - If the task involves references to private data or requires high-sensitivity decision-making, the system
will immediately invoke the private knowledge module to verify access permissions.

2. Inference by the General Model Integration Module

       - The system feeds the user request, multimodal inputs, and domain-specific knowledge (including private
data, if access is authorized) into the general-purpose language model for inference.

       - A brain-inspired memory tagging mechanism is introduced to preliminarily annotate key knowledge
points or reasoning paths involved in the current inference process.

3. Decision Output or Question Answering Result

       - The general model integration module produces an initial decision outcome or response, while the
multimodal decision-making module annotates and interprets visual outputs (e.g., diagnostic maps).

       - If private or sensitive information is involved, the system conducts a desensitization check prior to output,
ensuring that the generated text or images do not exceed the user’s permission scope.

**7.5** **Embodied Code Generation and Execution**

1. Triggering Hardware Control Requests

       - Once the system’s decision outcome includes requirements for robotic actions, wearable device scheduling,
or other hardware control tasks, the hardware control generation module is immediately activated.

       - For example, a user might input, “Please control the robotic arm to grasp the red object and place it in
area X," or the multimodal detection module may determine that “a specific valve needs to be shut off to
prevent further escalation of a malfunction."

2. Automated Script / Command Generation

       - Based on ROS2 or the target hardware’s API specifications, the hardware control generation module
translates natural language inputs or multimodal decision results into executable control scripts (e.g., in
Python, C++, etc.).

       - For different models or brands of robotic systems, a low-level adaptation layer translates the standardized
intermediate instructions into device-specific command formats compatible with the appropriate drivers.

3. Execution and State Feedback

       - The generated scripts or commands are dispatched in real time to the designated hardware. If the device
supports feedback (e.g., via sensors or status logs), the returned data is automatically routed into the
multimodal analysis module for secondary evaluation.

       - If obstacles or environmental changes arise during execution, the system can re-infer and quickly generate
an updated control strategy, achieving a dynamic, adaptive closed-loop process.

**7.6** **Neuro-Inspired Memory Tagging and Replay**

1. Key Decision Point Tagging

       - After completing a full cycle of interaction, reasoning, or hardware operation, the system attaches memory
annotations to critical information and reasoning steps, recording their weight distributions in multimodal
fusion and knowledge base retrieval.

15

A “Wenlu" Brain System for Multimodal Cognition and Embodied Decision-Making

       - If private data was accessed during the task, the access path is securely recorded to facilitate future
auditing and policy optimization.

2. Offline Replay and Reinforcement

       - During system idle periods or in offline batch processing, the system replays a set of previously annotated critical decisions. Reinforcement learning or parameter tuning techniques are used to improve
performance and accuracy on similar tasks.

       - This continual learning process does not require retraining the entire foundation model but only performs
lightweight fine-tuning on internal strategy parameters or fusion modules.

3. Index and Policy Updates

       - After replay, the system writes the improved strategies into the knowledge index or private data policy
modules, allowing future tasks to directly benefit.

       - This forms a positive feedback loop: multi-turn interaction _→_ memory tagging _→_ offline reinforcement
_→_ performance enhancement, driving self-evolution of the system.

**7.7** **System Maintenance and Expansion**

1. Incorporating New Industry Knowledge Bases

       - When expanding to new industries (e.g., agriculture, construction, energy), relevant knowledge bases can
be imported via incremental learning, with appropriate model plugins added to the multimodal feature
extraction stage.

       - The general language model only requires lightweight parameter updates, minimizing redundant training
overhead.

2. Updating Privacy Policies and Compliance Protocols

       - In response to evolving legal regulations or corporate compliance needs, the private knowledge unit’s
access rules, tagging schemes, and anonymization algorithms can be flexibly updated.

       - Encryption algorithms and security protocols are regularly reviewed to ensure the system remains
up-to-date with privacy and compliance standards.

3. Hardware Interface and Adaptation Layer Maintenance

       - As hardware is upgraded or new platforms are introduced, only the adaptation layer scripts and API
mappings in the hardware control generation module need to be updated-without affecting the higher-level
decision logic.

       - During long-term operation, data from various hardware failures or anomalies can be collected to further
improve the robustness of code generation.

**7.8** **Operational Example: Multimodal Diagnosis and Robotic Execution**

1. Scenario Description
Industrial scenario: A production line triggers a fault alert. The system receives data streams from sensors
(e.g., temperature, pressure), images from surveillance cameras, and textual descriptions from operators.

2. Multimodal Fusion and Privacy Determination
The multimodal decision unit performs feature extraction to identify the fault location. If proprietary component
information is involved, the private knowledge unit performs secure access validation.

3. General Model Reasoning and Output
Combining the industry knowledge base and general model capabilities, the system identifies the most probable
fault cause and recommends component replacement or parameter adjustments.

4. Automated Robot Maintenance Command Generation

The hardware control module translates the fault-handling strategy into robotic movement, grasping, and
inspection scripts. The robot executes the instructions and sends feedback data for secondary verification.

5. Offline Replay and Reinforcement Learning
During idle periods, the system replays the decision path, logs fault characteristics, repair methods, and
execution efficiency, contributing to enhanced future responses.
