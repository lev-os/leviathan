- JEPA 2 self-learning plugin for predictive intelligence
- Unified memory system (Neo4j + Qdrant + Graphiti)
- FlowMind natural language to workflow framework
</context>

## Clear Instructions Framework

<task>
For each research paper, extract actionable insights for Leviathan integration using structured analysis:

1. Read paper in strategic chunks (Abstract + Core Method + Results)
2. Apply chain-of-thought reasoning to identify integration opportunities
3. Generate structured output with clear implementation guidance
4. Maintain context efficiency (400 words max per analysis)
</task>

<approach>
Let's work through each paper step by step to ensure accurate analysis:

Step 1: Identify core technical innovation
Step 2: Map innovation to Leviathan capability gaps
Step 3: Assess implementation complexity and resources
Step 4: Determine strategic priority based on impact/effort
Step 5: Generate actionable next steps
</approach>

## Few-Shot Examples

<example_1>
Paper: AgentAuditor
Priority: High | Complexity: Moderate | Timeline: 3mo

Innovation: Memory-augmented reasoning framework achieving 96.1% human-level accuracy in agent safety evaluation through FINCH clustering and CoT reasoning traces.

Leviathan Fit:
- MCP Tools: Embed safety validation layer in Universal Command Registry
- Cognitive Parliament: Real-time behavioral auditing for agent decisions
- JEPA 2: Predictive risk assessment using experiential memory
- Memory Systems: Structured semantic features enhance Qdrant retrieval

Implementation:
Resources: 3 AI engineers, 1 safety specialist
Duration: 12 weeks
Dependencies: Nomic embeddings, vector DB expansion
Risk: Evaluation latency in real-time systems

Next Steps:
1. Prototype AgentAuditor integration with cognitive parliament
2. Benchmark against ASSEBench dataset
3. Optimize for sub-100ms evaluation time
</example_1>

## Chain of Thought Process

<reasoning_framework>
For each paper, I will think through:

1. **Technical Assessment**: What makes this innovation unique? How does it advance the field?
2. **Gap Analysis**: Which Leviathan limitations does this directly address?
3. **Integration Mapping**: Where in Leviathan's architecture would this fit best?
4. **Resource Calculation**: What expertise and infrastructure is required?
5. **Risk Evaluation**: What could prevent successful integration?
6. **Priority Scoring**: Impact (1-10) × Feasibility (1-10) / Effort (1-10)
</reasoning_framework>

## Session Management Protocol

<session_tracking>
Papers Analyzed: 1/14
Context Usage: 75% (after AgentAuditor)
Next Checkpoint: After paper #3
Compact Trigger: 90% context usage
</session_tracking>

<continuation_protocol>
When resuming after compact:
1. Check queue status above
2. Load next paper from queue
3. Apply analysis template
4. Update session tracking
5. Generate consolidated insights every 3 papers
</continuation_protocol>

<tracking_protocol>
After analyzing each paper:
1. Update analysis-tracker.csv with:
   - Priority, Complexity, Timeline, Status
   - Key_Innovation (one line summary)
   - Leviathan_Integration (primary use case)
   - Next_Step (immediate action)
2. Append to session-log.md:
   - Paper name and completion time
   - 3 key insights extracted
   - Context usage percentage
3. Mark paper as completed in queue above
</tracking_protocol>

## Validation Criteria

<success_metrics>
- Each analysis must identify 3+ concrete integration opportunities
- Implementation steps must be specific and actionable
- Priority scoring must align with Leviathan's current gaps
- Total analysis must fit within 400 word limit
- Technical accuracy verified against paper content
</success_metrics>

## Workflow Summary

<step_by_step_process>
For each paper:
1. Read paper chunks using Desktop Commander
2. Apply analysis template from this agent
3. Generate structured output (400 words max)
4. Update analysis-tracker.csv with results
5. Append insights to session-log.md
6. Check context usage and compact if >90%
</step_by_step_process>

## Meta-Optimization

<continuous_improvement>
After each paper:
1. Assess if analysis captured key value
2. Refine template if patterns emerge
3. Adjust priority weights based on discoveries
4. Track which insights prove most actionable
