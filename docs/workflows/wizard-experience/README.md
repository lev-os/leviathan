# 🧙‍♂️ Wizard Experience: Reverse Engineering Complex Concepts

## Overview

The Wizard Experience is an interactive pattern for breaking down complex concepts through guided questioning. Using a 1-5 numbered format, the wizard asks domain-specific questions that progressively reveal understanding while allowing for research, pivoting, and collaborative brainstorming.

## Core Philosophy

**"Transform overwhelming complexity into digestible understanding through magical inquiry"**

The wizard doesn't just ask questions - it:
- 🎯 Reverse engineers from the desired outcome
- 🔄 Adapts based on your responses
- 🔍 Conducts research when needed
- 💡 Offers recommendations you can accept or modify
- 🎨 Maintains an engaging, magical atmosphere

## Key Features

### 1. **Numbered Choice Format (1-N)**
Each question presents numbered options, making it easy to:
- Select a recommendation quickly
- Add your own details
- Combine multiple options
- Request alternatives

### 2. **Progressive Refinement**
Questions build upon previous answers, creating:
- Deeper understanding with each round
- Natural knowledge scaffolding
- Organic pivots when needed

### 3. **Research Integration**
The wizard can:
- Search for relevant documentation
- Analyze existing patterns
- Propose evidence-based solutions
- Validate assumptions in real-time

### 4. **Collaborative Intelligence**
Not just Q&A, but true collaboration:
- Wizard provides expertise
- User provides context
- Together they create solutions

## When to Use the Wizard

Perfect for:
- 📊 Consolidating complex documentation
- 🏗️ Designing system architectures
- 🔧 Reverse engineering implementations
- 📚 Creating comprehensive specifications
- 🎯 Breaking down ambitious goals

## Quick Start

```yaml
wizard_session:
  topic: "Your complex concept"
  goal: "What you want to achieve"
  constraints: "Any limitations"
  
# The wizard will then begin with domain questions...
```

## Example Session Flow

### Standard Pattern
```
🧙‍♂️: "Greetings! I sense you seek to [goal]. Let me ask you..."

**Question 1: What aspect should we focus on first?**
1. 📋 Current state analysis
2. 🎯 Desired outcome definition
3. 🔍 Gap identification
4. 🛠️ Implementation strategy
5. ✨ Something else? (please specify)

User: "2, but also need to understand current state"

🧙‍♂️: "Wise choice! Let's define the outcome while mapping the current landscape..."
```

### Enhanced with Five-Fold Path™
```
🧙‍♂️: "Ah, I see you face [complex challenge]. Let me first understand it deeply..."

[Applies Five-Fold Analysis]
- 🌊 Traces how the situation evolved
- 🎯 Identifies what success uniquely enables
- 🔗 Maps all connected elements
- 💎 Distills the core truth
- 🚀 Recognizes what assumption to break

🧙‍♂️: "The Five-Fold Path reveals fascinating insights! Based on this understanding:

**Question 1: Which approach resonates most?**
1. 📈 **Evolutionary** - Build on what's working (safe progression)
2. 🎯 **Impact-First** - Start with the end goal (outcome-driven)
3. 🔗 **Systems Approach** - Address all connections (holistic)
4. 💎 **Essential Focus** - Solve the ONE thing (laser-focused)
5. 🚀 **Revolutionary Leap** - Break the old paradigm (transformative)

User: "4 - let's focus on the essential"

🧙‍♂️: "Brilliant! By addressing the core truth, everything else falls into place..."
```

## Implementation Patterns

- **CLI Integration**: `lev wizard [topic]`
- **MCP Tool**: `wizard_experience` with progressive context
- **Workflow YAML**: Define domain-specific question trees
- **FlowMind Future**: `when_semantic: "user needs guidance"`
