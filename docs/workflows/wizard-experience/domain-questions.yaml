  application_pattern: |
    For any complex topic, guide through all five lenses:
    1. First, understand its evolution
    2. Then, analyze its unique impact
    3. Next, map its relationships
    4. Distill its core essence
    5. Finally, identify the paradigm shift
    
    This creates complete understanding.
