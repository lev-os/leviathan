# Leviathan Documentation Consolidation Quick Start

## Project Summary

We're consolidating ~250+ documents from 5 major sources into a unified `docs/` structure over 16 weeks. This will transform Leviathan from scattered concepts into a production-ready AI operating system.

## Key Documents Created

1. **[Consolidation Tracker](./consolidation-tracker.csv)** - Master task tracking (40+ tasks)
2. **[Process Guide](./consolidation-process.md)** - How to execute consolidation
3. **[Document Inventory](./consolidation-inventory.md)** - Complete file listing
4. **[Dependency Graph](./consolidation-dependencies.md)** - Concept relationships

## Critical Path Items

### The "Big 3" That Block Everything

1. **Bi-Directional Flow** (from mcp-ceo)

   - The "missing secret" for dynamic context
   - Blocks: Whisper evolution, MCP patterns
   - Location: `_ref/mcp-ceo/docs/`

2. **Package Architecture** (from \_core.md)

   - Core packages vs optional plugins
   - Blocks: All code organization
   - Location: `_core.md` + workshop analyses

3. **Memory Architecture** (3 competing designs)
   - Need to choose one approach
   - Blocks: Data persistence patterns
   - Location: `drafts/00[3-5]-*memory*.md`

## Immediate Actions (Today)

### 1. Review & Approve Structure (30 min)

```bash
# Review the consolidation plan
cat docs/consolidation-process.md
cat docs/consolidation-tracker.csv

# Check the inventory
cat docs/consolidation-inventory.md
```

### 2. Start Phase 0 Inventory (1 hour)

```bash
# Update tracker with actual file counts
# Mark P0T01 as complete
# Begin P0T02-P0T05 inventory tasks
```

### 3. Deep Dive: Bi-Directional Flow (2 hours)

```bash
# This is THE critical concept
cd _ref/mcp-ceo
cat docs/BIDIRECTIONAL-FLOW-DIAGRAM.md
cat README.md
# Understand FlowMind and dynamic context
```

## This Week's Goals

### Monday-Tuesday: Foundation

- [ ] Complete document inventory (P0T02-P0T05)
- [ ] Create dependency visualization
- [ ] Read core principles from orig-agent

### Wednesday-Thursday: Critical Concepts

- [ ] Extract bi-directional flow documentation
- [ ] Understand FlowMind architecture
- [ ] Document package vs plugin decision

### Friday: Planning

- [ ] Finalize Phase 1 task breakdown
- [ ] Resolve memory architecture approach
- [ ] Set up weekly review process

## Key Insights to Remember

### From the Analysis

1. **Whisper → Bi-Directional Evolution**

   - Current: Static navigation breadcrumbs
   - Future: Dynamic context assembly with callbacks
   - This changes EVERYTHING about guidance

2. **FlowMind = LLM as Runtime**

   - Not just using LLMs, LLM IS the execution engine
   - Context switching creates emergent intelligence
   - From mcp-ceo's working implementation

3. **Package Architecture Clarity**

   - If it's imported directly → Core package
   - If it's truly optional → Plugin
   - Stop pretending core components are plugins

4. **Workshop Scale**
   - 170+ AI tools to evaluate
   - Use 8-tier classification system
   - Focus on Tier 1-2 for immediate value

## Daily Routine

### Morning (15 min)

1. Check consolidation tracker
2. Review dependencies for today's tasks
3. Identify any blockers

### Work Block (3-4 hours)

1. Execute consolidation tasks
2. Update tracker status
3. Document decisions in appropriate ADR

### End of Day (30 min)

1. Commit documentation changes
2. Update tracker with progress
3. Plan tomorrow's tasks

## Success Checkpoints

### Week 1: Foundation Set

- [ ] All documents inventoried
- [ ] Critical concepts understood
- [ ] Dependency order established

### Week 2-3: Core Consolidation

- [ ] Architecture documents merged
- [ ] ADRs organized and updated
- [ ] Evolution paths documented

### Week 4-6: Implementation

- [ ] Code patterns extracted
- [ ] Package structure defined
- [ ] Migration guides created

### Week 7+: Integration

- [ ] Workshop tools classified
- [ ] Priority integrations planned
- [ ] Advanced features specified

## Remember

> "This is a marathon, not a sprint. Each phase builds on the previous one. Quality > Speed."

The goal is a **production-ready, cutting-edge AI OS** that preserves all revolutionary concepts while creating a clean, maintainable architecture.

## Get Started Now

```bash
# 1. Open the tracker
open docs/consolidation-tracker.csv

# 2. Start with P0T02 - inventory root _*.md files
ls -la _*.md > docs/temp-inventory.txt

# 3. Begin reading bi-directional flow
cat _ref/mcp-ceo/docs/BIDIRECTIONAL-FLOW-DIAGRAM.md
```
