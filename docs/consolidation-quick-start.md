# Leviathan Documentation Consolidation Quick Start

## Project Summary

We're consolidating ~250+ documents from 5 major sources into a unified `docs/` structure over 16 weeks. This will transform Leviathan from scattered concepts into a production-ready AI operating system.

## Key Documents Created

1. **[Consolidation Tracker](./consolidation-tracker.csv)** - Master task tracking (40+ tasks)
2. **[Process Guide](./consolidation-process.md)** - How to execute consolidation
3. **[Document Inventory](./consolidation-inventory.md)** - Complete file listing
4. **[Dependency Graph](./consolidation-dependencies.md)** - Concept relationships

## Critical Path Items

### v1.0 "Big 3" That Block Everything

1. **Package Architecture** (from \_core.md) ⚡️ CRITICAL

   - Core packages vs optional plugins
   - Blocks: ALL code organization
   - Must extract experimental features to plugins
   - Location: `_core.md` + workshop analyses

2. **Hexagonal Architecture** ⚡️ CRITICAL

   - Adapters route, core computes
   - NO business logic in adapters
   - Blocks: Clean code structure
   - Location: `_ref/orig-agent/docs/`

3. **Memory Interface** (not implementation) ⚡️ CRITICAL
   - Define interface only
   - Allow swappable backends
   - Blocks: Data persistence abstraction
   - Location: `drafts/00[3-5]-*memory*.md`

### v2.0 Research (NOT Blocking v1.0)

1. **Bi-Directional Flow** (from mcp-ceo) 🔬 RESEARCH

   - Revolutionary for v2.0
   - Study after v1.0 stable
   - Location: `_ref/mcp-ceo/docs/`

2. **FlowMind** (LLM as runtime) 🔬 RESEARCH
   - Game-changing concept
   - Requires stable v1.0 first
   - Location: `_ref/mcp-ceo/`

## Immediate Actions (Today)

### 1. Review & Approve Structure (30 min)

```bash
# Review the consolidation plan
cat docs/consolidation-process.md
cat docs/consolidation-tracker.csv

# Check the inventory
cat docs/consolidation-inventory.md
```

### 2. Start Phase 0 Inventory (1 hour)

```bash
# Update tracker with actual file counts
# Mark P0T01 as complete
# Begin P0T02-P0T05 inventory tasks
```

### 3. Deep Dive: Package Architecture (2 hours)

```bash
# This is THE critical v1.0 concept
cat _core.md
cat workshop/intake/mastra-package-architecture-analysis.md
# Understand what should be core vs plugin
# Identify experimental features to extract
```

## This Week's Goals (v1.0 Focus)

### Monday-Tuesday: Foundation

- [ ] Complete document inventory (P0T02-P0T05)
- [ ] Extract LLM-first principles from orig-agent
- [ ] Document hexagonal architecture patterns

### Wednesday-Thursday: v1.0 Critical Concepts

- [ ] Finalize package vs plugin separation
- [ ] Define memory interface (not implementation)
- [ ] Identify ALL experimental features to extract
- [ ] Document production MCP/CLI requirements

### Friday: v1.0 Planning

- [ ] Create v1.0 package structure plan
- [ ] List experimental features → plugins
- [ ] Set up v1.0 test framework goals
- [ ] Mark v2.0 research for later phases

## Key Insights to Remember

### v1.0 Technical Foundation (Build THIS First)

1. **Package Architecture Clarity** ⚡️

   - If it's imported directly → Core package
   - If it's truly optional → Plugin
   - STOP pretending core components are plugins
   - Extract ALL experimental features

2. **Hexagonal Architecture** ⚡️

   - Adapters route, core computes
   - Business logic ONLY in core
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Enables v2.0 evolution later

3. **Production Infrastructure** ⚡️
   - MCP server must be production-ready
   - CLI adapter needs 100% coverage
   - Memory interface, not implementation
   - Focus on stability over features

### v2.0 Revolutionary Concepts (Research Later)

1. **Bi-Directional Flow** 🔬

   - Revolutionary communication pattern
   - Study from mcp-ceo AFTER v1.0
   - Will transform everything

2. **FlowMind = LLM as Runtime** 🔬
   - Game-changing concept
   - Context switching creates intelligence
   - Requires stable v1.0 foundation

### Workshop Integration

- 170+ AI tools to evaluate
- Focus on Tier 1-2 for v1.0
- Ultimate MCP Server is priority

## Daily Routine

### Morning (15 min)

1. Check consolidation tracker
2. Review dependencies for today's tasks
3. Identify any blockers

### Work Block (3-4 hours)

1. Execute consolidation tasks
2. Update tracker status
3. Document decisions in appropriate ADR

### End of Day (30 min)

1. Commit documentation changes
2. Update tracker with progress
3. Plan tomorrow's tasks

## Success Checkpoints

### Week 1: Foundation Set

- [ ] All documents inventoried
- [ ] Critical concepts understood
- [ ] Dependency order established

### Week 2-3: Core Consolidation

- [ ] Architecture documents merged
- [ ] ADRs organized and updated
- [ ] Evolution paths documented

### Week 4-6: Implementation

- [ ] Code patterns extracted
- [ ] Package structure defined
- [ ] Migration guides created

### Week 7+: Integration

- [ ] Workshop tools classified
- [ ] Priority integrations planned
- [ ] Advanced features specified

## Remember

> "v1.0 = Production-ready technical foundation. NO experimental features in core."
>
> "v2.0 = Revolutionary features AFTER v1.0 is stable."

The goal is a **production-ready v1.0** that enables revolutionary v2.0 features through clean architecture.

### v1.0 Mantra

- Extract experimental features to plugins
- Hexagonal architecture everywhere
- 100% test coverage is non-negotiable
- If it's not stable, it's not v1.0

## Get Started Now

```bash
# 1. Open the tracker - focus on CRITICAL priority items
open docs/consolidation-tracker.csv

# 2. Read package architecture decisions
cat _core.md
cat workshop/intake/mastra-package-architecture-analysis.md

# 3. Identify experimental features to extract
grep -r "constitutional" agent/src/
grep -r "eeps" agent/src/
grep -r "personality" agent/src/

# 4. Start v1.0 foundation work
# Focus on: P1T05, P1T06, P1T07, P3T01-P3T03
```

_v1.0 First. Revolutionary features later. Let's build a rock-solid foundation._
