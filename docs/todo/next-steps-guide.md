# Next Steps Guide: Where to Start After Phase -1

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

âœ… **Phase -1 COMPLETE**: Repository structure cleaned and organized  
âœ… **Phase 0.5**: 5/8 revolutionary concepts synthesized  
ðŸ”„ **Phase 0**: Inventory tasks still pending (foundation for everything else)  

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Execution Plan

### **STEP 1: Complete Phase 0 Foundation (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**

Phase 0 tasks are the foundation - they tell us what we have before we decide how to organize it.

#### 1A. Update File Inventories (30 minutes)
Since we moved files in Phase -1, update the pending inventory tasks:

**P0T02**: Document inventory - root _*.md files âžœ **NOW LOCATED IN**: `docs/features/`
- Update inventory to reflect new locations
- Files like `_01-whisper.md` â†’ `docs/features/_01-whisper.md`

**P0T03**: Document inventory - drafts/ folder âžœ **UNCHANGED**
- Still in `/drafts/` - not moved
- 15+ draft documents including ADRs

**P0T04**: Document inventory - _ref/ projects âžœ **NOW LOCATED IN**: `docs/archive/external-projects/_ref/`
- Core principles and bi-directional flow concepts
- FlowMind implementation patterns

**P0T05**: Document inventory - workshop/ âžœ **UNCHANGED**
- 170+ tools evaluation and integration plans

#### 1B. Create Dependency Graph (45 minutes)
**P0T06**: Map relationships between concepts
- Which documents reference each other?
- What are the logical groupings?
- What depends on what?

#### 1C. Prioritize Consolidation Order (15 minutes)
**P0T07**: Define execution sequence
- Critical path: Core principles â†’ Architecture â†’ Specs
- Dependencies: Memory systems need principles first

### **STEP 2: Choose Your Focus Area (Pick ONE)**

After Phase 0 foundation, choose based on your immediate needs:

#### Option A: **Architecture Foundation** (Start with P1T01, P1T05)
**Best if**: You need solid technical foundation for development

**Next Tasks**:
1. **P1T01**: Extract core principles from `docs/archive/external-projects/_ref/orig-agent/CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`
2. **P1T05**: Package architecture from `docs/features/_core.md`

**Time**: ~6 hours total  
**Output**: Solid foundation docs in `docs/architecture/`

#### Option B: **Current System Documentation** (Start with P1T03)
**Best if**: You need to document what exists now

**Next Tasks**:
1. **P1T03**: Document current Whisper system from `docs/features/_01-whisper.md`
2. **P1T06**: Consolidate memory architecture options from `drafts/`

**Time**: ~6 hours total  
**Output**: Clear specs for existing systems

#### Option C: **Revolutionary Concepts Completion** (Phase 0.5 remaining)
**Best if**: You want to finish the breakthrough concept work

**Remaining Tasks** (3/8 left):
- P05T06: Pickaxe-Mastra-BiDirectional Integration Analysis
- P05T07: MCP Multiplexer SSE Architecture  
- P05T08: Claude-Code-Flow Multi-Agent Integration

**Time**: ~10 hours total  
**Output**: Complete revolutionary concept library

### **STEP 3: Execution Pattern**

For any task you choose:

1. **Read Source Files** (15 min)
   - Use the file paths in consolidation-tracker.csv
   - Understand what concepts are covered

2. **Identify Target Structure** (10 min)
   - Check if target directory exists
   - Plan the document organization

3. **Extract and Synthesize** (30-60 min per doc)
   - Pull key concepts from source files
   - Organize into clear, production-ready documentation
   - Link to related concepts

4. **Update Tracker** (5 min)
   - Mark task as complete
   - Update any dependent task files paths

5. **Verify Links** (10 min)
   - Check that references work
   - Update any cross-references

## ðŸŽ¯ My Recommendation: START HERE

**Go with Option A (Architecture Foundation)** because:

1. **P1T01 (Core Principles)** gives you the philosophical foundation
2. **P1T05 (Package Architecture)** gives you the practical structure  
3. These unlock many other tasks that depend on them
4. Foundation work prevents rework later

### Immediate Next Action:
```bash
# 1. Look at the core principles source
cat docs/archive/external-projects/_ref/orig-agent/CORE_PRINCIPLES.md

# 2. Look at package architecture source  
cat docs/features/_core.md

# 3. Start with P1T01 - extract to docs/architecture/01-llm-first-principles.md
```

## ðŸ”„ Weekly Rhythm Suggestion

**Monday**: Pick 1-2 tasks from critical path  
**Tuesday-Thursday**: Execute tasks (2-3 hours each)  
**Friday**: Update trackers, review progress, plan next week  

**Goal**: Complete 3-5 tasks per week = finish consolidation in 4-6 weeks

## ðŸš« What NOT to Do

- Don't start multiple phases at once
- Don't skip the Phase 0 foundation work
- Don't try to perfect individual docs - focus on coverage first
- Don't get distracted by new features - finish consolidation first

## ðŸ¤” Still Unsure?

**If overwhelmed**: Start with **just P0T02** - update the file inventory to reflect Phase -1 moves. Takes 15 minutes and gives you momentum.

**If excited about concepts**: Finish the **3 remaining Phase 0.5 tasks** - complete the revolutionary concept synthesis work.

**If practical-minded**: Go straight to **P1T01 + P1T05** - get the core architecture documented.

The key is to **start somewhere** and build momentum. The organization structure is ready - now we fill it with content systematically.
