# Everything is Context

## Concept

In the Leviathan LLM-first architecture, the fundamental principle of "Everything is Context" dictates that all aspects of the system, from agents and workflows to patterns and data, are treated as configurable contexts. This approach eliminates rigid hierarchies and enables unparalleled flexibility, allowing the LLM to dynamically adapt its behavior and capabilities based on the specific situation.

This means that instead of hardcoding logic or relying on complex class inheritance, the system's behavior is primarily defined and orchestrated through the composition and manipulation of various contexts, often expressed in YAML.

## Key Aspects

*   **Unified Representation:** Agents, workflows, patterns, and data are all represented as contexts, simplifying the system's mental model and promoting interoperability.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:** The LLM's behavior is configured at runtime by loading and composing relevant contexts, allowing for highly adaptive and situation-aware responses.
*   **Flexibility and Extensibility:** New behaviors and capabilities can be introduced by simply defining new contexts, without requiring changes to core code or complex class structures.
*   **LLM as Orchestrator:** The LLM itself plays a crucial role in interpreting, assembling, and leveraging these contexts to drive the system's actions.
