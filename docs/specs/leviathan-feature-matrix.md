## üìã Implementation Priority Matrix

### Phase 1: Constitutional Framework (Week 1-2)
1. **@lev-os/schema behavioral specs** - Foundation for everything else
2. **Template intelligence specification** - BMAD-inspired patterns
3. **Instance configuration system** - Fractal deployment patterns

### Phase 2: Assembly System (Week 3-4)  
1. **@lev-os/legos behavioral specs** - How contexts get assembled
2. **Workshop MCP tool integration** - Automation patterns
3. **Context library design** - Storage and retrieval patterns

### Phase 3: Meta-System (Week 5-6)
1. **Workshop feature completion** - Full wizard experience
2. **Agent orchestration specs** - CEO + synth patterns  
3. **End-to-end integration testing** - Full system validation

## üéØ BDD-First Development Workflow

### For Each Module:
1. **Define Features** - What should this module DO?
2. **Write BDD Specs** - Behavioral specifications in Gherkin
3. **Create Behavioral Docs** - Detailed behavior descriptions
4. **Define Contracts** - Input/output specifications
5. **Implement Tests** - Driven by the specs
6. **Generate Documentation** - Derived from specs
7. **Build Implementation** - Validated by tests

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Every feature has a BDD specification
- [ ] Every spec has corresponding tests
- [ ] Every test passes before implementation begins
- [ ] Documentation is generated from specs
- [ ] All modules follow the same spec structure
