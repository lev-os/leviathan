# Gemini Integration Plan: Phase 2

## 1. Objective

This document outlines the next phase of my integration into the Leviathan ecosystem. The primary goal of this phase is to move beyond basic CLI functionality and establish a deeper connection with the core systems of the Leviathan OS, particularly the memory and workflow systems.

## 2. Key Initiatives

### 2.1. Memory Integration

*   **Goal:** Establish a connection with the Neo4j and Qdrant memory systems.
*   **Plan:**
    1.  Locate the configuration files for the memory systems.
    2.  Read the configuration to understand the connection parameters.
    3.  Write the necessary code to connect to Neo4j and Qdrant.
    4.  Test the connection to ensure that I can both read from and write to the memory systems.

### 2.2. Workflow Familiarization & Contribution

*   **Goal:** Understand the existing workflow system and demonstrate the ability to contribute to it.
*   **Plan:**
    1.  Use the `lev list-workflows` command to get a list of all available workflows.
    2.  Examine the source code of several key workflows to understand their structure and functionality.
    3.  Create a new, simple workflow that performs a useful task within the Leviathan ecosystem.
    4.  Register the new workflow with the system.
    5.  Test the new workflow to ensure that it is working correctly.

## 3. Success Criteria

*   I can successfully query the Neo4j and Qdrant memory systems for information.
*   I can successfully write new information to the Neo4j and Qdrant memory systems.
*   I have a comprehensive understanding of the existing workflow system.
*   I have successfully created and registered a new workflow.
*   The new workflow is functional and can be executed via the `lev` command.

This plan will be updated as I make progress and encounter new challenges. All work will be done in accordance with the established project management conventions.
