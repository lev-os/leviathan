## üîÑ How to Continue This Session

### For Claude Code Users:
```bash
# Load this continuation state
claude "I'm continuing the whisper architecture wizard. We've completed Steps 1-3 and created ADRs 008-010. 

Progress summary:
- Step 1: Hybrid evolutionary approach (situation-aware ‚Üí learning ‚Üí bi-directional)
- Step 2: System effectiveness optimization (not user learning, not self-learning research)  
- Step 3: Recipe-based assembly (TBD - start with loose object whispers)

I need to continue with Step 4 (Dual LLM Integration) and Step 5 (Implementation Priority). 

Please load the whisper-wizard-continuation.md file and continue the guided wizard experience."

## üß† Session Context Summary

### FlowMind Research Insights Discovered:
1. **LLM IS THE RUNTIME** - LLM itself is execution engine, not just text generator
2. **Bi-Directional Flow** - Every component teaches every other component
3. **Context Switching = Intelligence** - Each context switch gives LLM new capabilities  
4. **Semantic Conditions** - LLM evaluates "user seems frustrated" through reasoning
5. **Single Class Design** - Everything is FlowMind context, behavior from YAML

### Key Architectural Decisions Made:

#### ADR-008: Whisper System Architecture Evolution
**Decision**: Hybrid evolutionary approach through 4 phases
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Situation-aware whispers (new/stuck/successful users)
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): Effectiveness learning and tracking
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-8): Progressive refinement patterns  
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 9-12): Context assembly recipes

#### ADR-009: Whisper Learning Mechanisms  
**Decision**: System effectiveness optimization (Avenue 2)
- **NOT** user preference learning (Avenue 1) - requires user feedback systems
- **NOT** self-learning research (Avenue 3) - JEPA 2/MIT SEAL territory
- **YES** objective whisper effectiveness across LLMs and projects

#### ADR-010: Context Assembly Strategy
**Decision**: TBD - Recipe-based with loose object foundation
- Start with validated loose object whispers
- Evolve to YAML recipes + JS rules engine
- Support both Claude Code (file references) and Web UI (hosted content)
- Eventually semantic condition evaluation

### Current Implementation Priority:
1. **Immediate**: Validate loose object whispers (already proven effective)
2. **Phase 1**: Situation-aware whisper detection  
3. **Phase 2**: System effectiveness optimization
4. **Future**: Recipe-based context assembly

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Wizard Steps Remaining

### Step 4: Dual LLM Integration Plan

**Question**: Should whispers implement FlowMind's dual LLM architecture?

**Options to Evaluate**:
- **Option A**: Single LLM (Current) - User's chosen LLM handles everything
- **Option B**: Dual LLM FlowMind Pattern - Beta LLM (user) + Alpha LLM (optimization)  
- **Option C**: Optional Dual Mode - Feature flag approach

**FlowMind Pattern Reference**:
```
Beta LLM (Claude/GPT-4): User interaction, command execution
Alpha LLM (TinyLlama): Whisper optimization, context analysis  
MCP Server: Coordination with continuous learning loops
```

### Step 5: Implementation Priority & Roadmap

**Question**: What's the optimal implementation sequence?

**Options to Evaluate**:
- **Priority A**: Foundation First (situation-aware ‚Üí learning ‚Üí context assembly ‚Üí dual LLM)
- **Priority B**: Learning First (bi-directional feedback ‚Üí progressive refinement ‚Üí situation-aware)
- **Priority C**: FlowMind All-In (implement full patterns immediately)

**Current Constraint**: Need to validate loose object whispers before any complex evolution

## üìä Decision Matrix Template

### For Continuing the Wizard:

**Step 4 Decision Criteria**:
- Implementation complexity vs benefits
- FlowMind pattern alignment
- Current Leviathan architecture fit
- Resource requirements (dual LLM = 2x API costs)

**Step 5 Decision Criteria**:
- Risk vs reward for each implementation phase
- Validation requirements before proceeding
- Resource allocation and timeline constraints
- Production stability needs

---

## üéØ Expected Outputs

### Remaining ADRs to Create:
- **ADR-011**: Dual LLM Integration Plan (from Step 4)
- **ADR-012**: Implementation Roadmap (from Step 5)

### Final Deliverables:
- Complete whisper architecture decision set (5 ADRs)
- Clear implementation roadmap with phases
- Risk assessment and validation criteria
- FlowMind pattern integration strategy
