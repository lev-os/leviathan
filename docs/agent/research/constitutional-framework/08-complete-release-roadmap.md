```
Project Level:    $PROJECT/.kingly/contexts/
Personal Global:  ~/.kingly/contexts/  
Community:        @kingly/, @community/ packages
```

#### Context Promotion Pipeline
- `kingly share global ./contexts/agent/researcher`
  - Creates personal://agents/researcher reference
  - Tracks effectiveness metrics
  - Constitutional compliance validation

- `kingly share community personal://agents/researcher`
  - Creates @username/agent-researcher package
  - Community validation pipeline
  - NPM-style distribution

#### Reference Resolution System
```yaml
# context.yaml inheritance across levels
extends:
  - "./base-agent"                    # Local project context
  - "personal://agents/researcher"    # Personal global context  
  - "@community/agent-researcher"     # Community package
```

#### Semantic Discovery Engine
- Cross-level semantic search
- Constitutional compliance scoring
- Usage effectiveness metrics
- AI-powered recommendations

### Phase 3: Community Alpha (v0.3.0)
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies:** Fractal system working

#### Package Installation System (shadcn-style)
```bash
# Install community package as source (not dependency)
kingly install @community/agent-researcher
# Copies source to ./.kingly/contexts/agents/researcher.yaml
# Full ownership, no version conflicts

# Discover packages semantically
kingly discover "creative writing assistant"
# AI-powered search across community registry
```

- Network effects metrics and optimization

#### Developer Experience
- Complete documentation and guides
- Tutorial series and examples
- CLI with intuitive commands
- VSCode extension for context editing
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD integration

## Technical Architecture Evolution

### Phase 1: Direct Function Calls
```javascript
// Core function implementation
export async function installContext(contextRef, options) {
  // Constitutional validation, source resolution, installation
}

// Multiple interfaces to same functions
await commandRegistry.execute('context-install.install', args);  // Direct
await cliAdapter.handleCommand('install', args);                 // CLI  
await mcpAdapter.handleTool('kingly_install_context', args);     // MCP
```

### Phase 2: Fractal Context Resolution
```javascript
// Intelligent reference resolution
const context = await contextSystem.resolve('personal://agents/researcher');
// Resolves across project â†’ personal â†’ community levels
// Applies inheritance with local precedence
// Validates constitutional compliance
```

### Phase 3: Community Integration
```javascript
// Package discovery and installation
const packages = await registry.discover('strategic planning');
// Semantic search with constitutional filtering
// Community curation and quality metrics
// Source-based installation with full ownership
```

### Phase 4: Network Intelligence
```javascript
// AI-powered recommendations
const suggestions = await intelligence.recommend(userContext, taskType);
// Learns from community usage patterns
// Optimizes for constitutional compliance
// Suggests context combinations and improvements
```

## Constitutional Compliance Framework

### Six Core Principles (All Phases)
1. **Optimal Neurochemical State First** - Adaptive brain chemistry optimization
2. **Bootstrap Sovereignty** - Minimal dependencies, local execution
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Complexity only when needed
4. **Recursive Excellence** - Each use improves understanding
5. **Economic Empowerment** - Creates opportunities and value
6. **Multi-Verse Scaling** - Personal to civilizational applicability

### Quality Gates by Phase
- **Phase 1:** Constitutional validation suggested (>= 0.7)
- **Phase 2:** Personal global requires effectiveness proof (>= 0.8)
- **Phase 3:** Community sharing requires multi-user validation (>= 0.95)
- **Phase 4:** Featured packages require exceptional quality (>= 0.98)

## Revolutionary Impact

This creates the world's first **Constitutional AI Package Manager** where:

1. **Intelligence Distribution** - Share AI reasoning patterns, not just code
2. **Fractal Scaling** - Personal innovation becomes community value
3. **Constitutional Guarantee** - All shared intelligence optimizes for human flourishing
4. **Ownership Preservation** - Users control their AI configurations completely
5. **Network Effects** - Collective intelligence improves through use

The result is a **living intelligence ecosystem** that grows smarter and more ethical through actual use, with clear pathways for individual innovation to become civilizational coordination tools.

## Current Status Summary
- **Phase 1:** 70% complete, needs manual context consolidation
- **Phase 2:** Architecture designed, ready for implementation
- **Phase 3:** Community model designed, needs Phase 2 foundation
- **Phase 4:** Vision clear, depends on community traction

**Next Session Priority:** Complete Phase 1 context consolidation with manual process.
