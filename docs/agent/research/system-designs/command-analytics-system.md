# Command Analytics System - Draft

**Status:** Concept/Iteration Phase  
**Goal:** Drive self-learning and workflow optimization through usage analytics

## Core Concept

Leverage existing whisper-system.js infrastructure to capture command usage patterns and enable the system to learn from user behavior, improving workflow recommendations over time.

## Analytics Collection Areas

### 1. Command Usage Patterns
- **Frequency tracking:** Which commands are used most (find, load, ping, etc.)
- **Command sequences:** What follows what (find â†’ load â†’ ping patterns)
- **Success rates:** Which commands lead to user satisfaction signals
- **Error patterns:** Common failure points and user recovery paths

### 2. Workflow Discovery Intelligence
- **Search effectiveness:** Which search terms lead to successful workflow matches
- **Similarity threshold analysis:** Optimal confidence levels for recommendations
- **Suggestion success:** When users accept vs reject workflow suggestions
- **Natural language patterns:** Which NLP queries work best

### 3. Session Behavior Analytics
- **Session duration:** How long users work in different contexts
- **Checkpoint frequency:** Optimal ping intervals for different work types
- **Context switching:** When users jump between projects/workflows
- **Rollup patterns:** What makes successful session handoffs

### 4. Interaction Mode Analysis
- **Explicit vs Natural Language:** Usage ratio and effectiveness
- **Help system engagement:** Which commands need better documentation
- **CEO orchestration usage:** Multi-tab coordination patterns
- **Whisper effectiveness:** When LLM guidance improves outcomes

## Self-Learning Mechanisms

### Recommendation Engine Evolution
- **Workflow suggestion improvement:** Learn which workflows work for specific contexts
- **Contextual command suggestions:** Predict next likely commands based on current state
- **Personal workflow patterns:** Adapt to individual user preferences
- **Project-specific optimization:** Learn patterns within specific codebases

### Adaptive Whisper Generation
- **Context-aware guidance:** Improve LLM whispers based on past success
- **Personalized advice:** Adapt CEO advice to user's working patterns
- **Error recovery suggestions:** Learn better alternatives from failure patterns
- **Confidence calibration:** Improve similarity thresholds for recommendations

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Analytics Infrastructure
- Extend `whisper-system.js` with analytics collection methods
- Create `~/.kingly/analytics/` directory structure
- Design privacy-first, local-only storage format
- Implement minimal performance impact collection

### Phase 2: Learning Algorithms
- Basic frequency analysis and pattern detection
- Workflow recommendation scoring improvements
- Session behavior analysis for optimization
- Command sequence prediction

### Phase 3: Self-Improvement
- Dynamic whisper generation based on learned patterns
- Adaptive command suggestions
- Context-aware workflow recommendations
- Personalized CEO advice evolution

## Technical Integration Points

### Whisper System Enhancement
```javascript
// Add to whisper-system.js
async generateAnalyticsEvent(command, result, context) {
  const event = {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    command,
    success: result.success,
    context_type: this.detectContextType(),
    user_satisfaction_signals: this.detectSatisfactionSignals(result),
    workflow_effectiveness: this.measureWorkflowEffectiveness(result)
  };
  
  await this.logAnalyticsEvent(event);
}
```

### Learning Engine Structure
```javascript
class LearningEngine {
  analyzeUsagePatterns() {
    // Discover command sequences and effectiveness
  }
  
  improveRecommendations() {
    // Adjust workflow suggestion algorithms
  }
  
  adaptWhispers() {
    // Personalize LLM guidance based on learned patterns
  }
}
```

## Privacy & Performance Considerations

### Local-First Approach
- All analytics stored locally in `~/.kingly/analytics/`
- No external data transmission
- User controls retention and deletion
- Opt-in analytics collection

### Performance Optimization
- Async analytics collection (non-blocking)
- Efficient storage format (compressed JSON/binary)
- Background processing for analysis
- Minimal memory footprint

## Metrics Dashboard Concept

### `kingly status --metrics`
```
ðŸ“Š KINGLY USAGE ANALYTICS

Command Frequency (Last 30 days):
  find: 45 uses (avg confidence: 73%)
  load: 23 uses (avg session: 18 min)
  ping: 67 uses (checkpoint efficiency: +15%)

Workflow Discovery:
  Success rate: 78% (+5% this week)
  Top searches: "creative problem solving", "strategic planning"
  Learning: Natural language queries 23% more effective

Recommendations:
  âœ¨ Consider using 'combos' for complex planning tasks
  ðŸ“ˆ Your ping frequency is optimal for current project type
  ðŸŽ¯ Workflow 2k effectiveness up 12% in your usage
```

## Iteration Questions

1. **What specific user behaviors indicate successful workflow outcomes?**
2. **How can we measure "workflow effectiveness" beyond similarity scores?**
3. **What privacy boundaries are important for analytics collection?**
4. **Which learning algorithms would be most valuable for workflow recommendation?**
5. **How should the system balance learned patterns vs exploration of new workflows?**

## Next Steps

1. **Prototype analytics collection** in whisper-system.js
2. **Design analytics storage format** for local collection
3. **Implement basic usage tracking** for command frequency
4. **Create metrics dashboard** foundation in CLI
5. **Experiment with recommendation algorithms** based on usage data

**Goal:** Enable the system to become smarter about workflow recommendations through understanding actual usage patterns and effectiveness.
