## Intelligence Types and Classification

### Context Classifications
```yaml
intelligence_types:
  breakthrough:
    priority: highest
    propagation: immediate
    retention: permanent
    
  pattern:
    priority: high
    propagation: delayed
    retention: long-term
    
  workflow:
    priority: medium
    propagation: on-demand
    retention: medium-term
    
  tactical:
    priority: low  
    propagation: local-only
    retention: short-term
```

### Pattern Categories
```yaml
pattern_categories:
  architectural:
    description: "System design and structure patterns"
    cross_workspace_value: highest
    
  debugging:
    description: "Problem identification and resolution patterns"  
    cross_workspace_value: high
    
  optimization:
    description: "Performance and efficiency patterns"
    cross_workspace_value: medium
    
  workflow:
    description: "Process and methodology patterns"
    cross_workspace_value: medium
```

## Distributed Intelligence Algorithms

### 1. Contextual Relevance Scoring
```typescript
interface RelevanceScore {
  semantic_similarity: number;    // 0.0 - 1.0
  temporal_relevance: number;     // 0.0 - 1.0  
  workspace_similarity: number;   // 0.0 - 1.0
  pattern_match: number;          // 0.0 - 1.0
  cross_reference_weight: number; // 0.0 - 1.0
  
  composite_score: number;        // Weighted combination
  confidence_interval: [number, number];
}
```

### 2. Intelligence Routing Algorithm
```typescript
interface RoutingDecision {
  source_workspace: string;
  target_workspaces: string[];
  intelligence_type: IntelligenceType;
  routing_strategy: 'broadcast' | 'targeted' | 'on-demand';
  priority_level: number;
  estimated_latency: number;
}
```

### 3. Pattern Evolution Engine
```typescript
interface PatternEvolution {
  base_pattern: Pattern;
  contributing_contexts: Context[];
  evolution_vector: EvolutionVector;
  confidence_metrics: ConfidenceMetrics;
  next_evolution_prediction: Pattern;
}
```

## Privacy and Security

### Workspace Isolation Controls
```yaml
privacy_settings:
  isolation_level:
    - none: "Full cross-workspace sharing"
    - selective: "Curated intelligence sharing"
    - restricted: "Pattern-only sharing"
    - isolated: "No cross-workspace sharing"
    
  contribution_filtering:
    - automatic: "AI-driven privacy filtering"
    - manual: "User-controlled contribution"
    - whitelist: "Approved patterns only"
    - blacklist: "Exclude sensitive patterns"
```

### Intelligence Sanitization
```typescript
interface SanitizationRules {
  pii_detection: boolean;
  credential_scrubbing: boolean;
  business_logic_filtering: boolean;
  custom_patterns: RegExp[];
  sanitization_level: 'basic' | 'standard' | 'strict';
}
```

## BDD Scenarios

```gherkin
Feature: Distributed Intelligence Network
  Scenario: Cross-workspace pattern sharing
    Given breakthrough insight in workspace A
    When pattern significance exceeds threshold
    Then intelligence propagates to related workspaces
    And pattern recognition engine learns from distribution
    
  Scenario: Real-time intelligence routing
    Given user request for debugging patterns
    When local cache misses requested pattern
    Then global intelligence hub queries network
    And aggregated response includes cross-workspace insights
    And local cache updates with new intelligence
    
  Scenario: Pattern evolution and learning
    Given multiple workspaces with similar challenges
    When pattern usage patterns are analyzed
    Then meta-patterns emerge from cross-workspace data
    And evolved patterns distribute to relevant workspaces
    And pattern effectiveness is tracked and measured

  Scenario: Privacy-preserving intelligence sharing
    Given workspace with isolation_level=selective
    When intelligence contribution is triggered
    Then privacy filters analyze contribution content
    And only approved patterns propagate to network
    And sensitive context remains workspace-local
```
