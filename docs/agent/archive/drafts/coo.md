# Kingly Web Platform Integration Strategy

Based on analysis of your systems, here's how to use Kingly to manage a website using the ports/adapters architecture:

## Current Asset Analysis:
1. **Kingly CLI Core** (`~/digital/kingly/core/mcp-mvp`) - Working semantic search & context discovery
2. **Discord Agent** (`~/r/discord-agent`) - Bot system with agent registry & status updates  
3. **Web Server** (`~/k/hub/ceo`) - Next.js 15 platform with AI SDK & database
4. **AI Jared COO Specs** (`~/Downloads/jared.txt`) - Comprehensive PRD for AI assistant

## Ports/Adapters Web Architecture:

**Core Kingly Domain** (unchanged):
- Context discovery engine
- Workflow orchestration
- Session management
- CEO intelligence system

**Web Adapter Layer** (new):
- HTTP API endpoints exposing Kingly functionality
- Web UI for context browsing and workflow execution
- Job/ticket submission system for web users
- Real-time updates via WebSockets

## Integration Strategy:

### 1. Web-to-Kingly Bridge
- Create REST API in Next.js that calls Kingly CLI commands
- Expose `find`, `status`, `job` commands via HTTP endpoints
- Implement job queue for async workflow execution
- Add WebSocket for real-time status updates

### 2. Job/Ticket System
- Web users submit tickets through UI
- Tickets become Kingly jobs via `kingly job <description>`
- You receive jobs through Discord agent notifications
- Accept/reject jobs using existing `kingly load --accept-job` flow

### 3. Discord Integration Bridge
- Discord agent monitors Kingly job queue
- Sends notifications when new web tickets arrive
- Allows you to manage jobs from Discord
- Bridges web user communication back through Discord

### 4. AI Jared COO Integration
- Use Jared specs to create web-friendly AI interface
- Implement meeting intelligence for web conferences
- Add document analysis endpoints for web uploads
- Voice integration for web-based meetings

## Implementation Plan:

### Phase 1: Basic Web Adapter
- Create API routes in Next.js that shell out to Kingly CLI
- Build simple job submission form
- Implement basic status dashboard

### Phase 2: Job Management System
- Integrate Discord notifications for new web jobs
- Add job acceptance/rejection flow
- Implement real-time status updates

### Phase 3: AI Jared Features
- Add document upload and analysis
- Implement meeting bot integration
- Create business intelligence dashboard

### Phase 4: Advanced Integration
- Full context discovery web interface
- Workflow builder UI
- Multi-user collaboration features

## Technical Implementation Notes:

### API Design
```typescript
// Next.js API routes
/api/kingly/find - POST with query, returns contexts
/api/kingly/job - POST to submit jobs
/api/kingly/status - GET current system status
/api/jobs - GET/POST for job management
```

### Job Flow
```
Web User → Submit Ticket → Kingly Job Queue → Discord Notification → You Accept → Work in CLI → Update Status → Web User Sees Progress
```

### Discord Integration
- Monitor `.kingly/jobs/` directory for new submissions
- Send notifications with job details and accept/reject buttons
- Update job status back to web interface

This approach preserves Kingly's CLI-first architecture while making it accessible to web users through a clean adapter layer. You maintain full control through Discord while web users get a polished interface.
