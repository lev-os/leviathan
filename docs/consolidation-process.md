## Consolidation Phases

### Phase -1: Repository Structure Cleanup (NEW - Prerequisites) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Create organized structure before content consolidation

**Key Activities**:

1. Create flat organization buckets (docs/{agent,features,drafts,archive,todo,tmp}) ✅
2. Move agent/docs → docs/agent/ (agent should be sparse) ✅  
3. Organize root _*.md files into proper buckets ✅
4. Archive external projects to docs/archive/external-projects/ ✅
5. Consolidate tmp folders to docs/tmp/ ✅

**Deliverables**:

- Clean root directory (only README.md, CLAUDE.md, _repo.md, _desktop.md) ✅
- Organized documentation structure under /docs/ ✅
- Agent folder sparse (code only) ✅
- External projects archived ✅
- Flat structure (maximum 2 levels deep) ✅

**Completion Summary**:

- Moved 20+ root _*.md files to appropriate buckets
- Relocated agent/docs/ to docs/agent/ (agent is now a sparse monorepo package)
- Archived external projects (_ref/) while preserving for concept extraction
- Consolidated agent/tmp/ and workshop/tmp/ to docs/tmp/
- Created navigable flat structure avoiding deep nesting
