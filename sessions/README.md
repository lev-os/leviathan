# Sessions - LLM-First Intelligence Crystallization

## Philosophy

Sessions are **intelligence crystallization laboratories** where:
- Rolling synths evolve through usage
- Breakthrough patterns emerge and solidify  
- Successful techniques become permanent contexts
- System learns and improves itself through meta-learning

## Session Structure

```
sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{semantic-slug}/
├── readme.yaml                     # Session intelligence core
├── synths-{type}-{slug}.yaml      # Rolling synth definitions
├── prompts-{reason}.md            # Prompt engineering experiments
├── freestyle/                     # Session-specific needs
└── history/                       # Timeline events + checkpoints
    └── {timestamp}-{event}.yaml
```

## Intelligence Patterns

### Rolling Synths = Grooves in the Brain
- **Grooves form through use** - successful thinking patterns strengthen
- **Good thoughts bubble up** - breakthrough insights surface naturally
- **Crystallization happens** - patterns harden into permanent intelligence
- **Diamond formation** - multiple sessions refine the same patterns

### Session Timeline Tracking
Every significant event creates a timeline entry:
```yaml
{timestamp}-{semantic-event}.yaml:
  session_event: "context-discovery" 
  timestamp: "2025-07-03T15:30:00Z"
  session_id: "{session-id}"
  description: "Found 75+ contexts in system"
  synth_performance: {...}
  next_actions: [...]
```

### Crystallization Pipeline
```
Session Intelligence → Timeline Events → Pattern Recognition → Permanent Contexts
                    ↓
Rolling Synths → Usage Tracking → Promotion Candidates → Core Contexts
                    ↓  
Prompt Experiments → Breakthrough Patterns → Command Templates → Claude Commands
```

## Wizard-Heavy Operations

**All workflow operations use plan/simulate/human-in-the-loop/act process:**

### Session Split/Merge
- **Plan**: Wizard analyzes session complexity and boundaries
- **Simulate**: Show proposed session organization
- **HITL**: Human approval of session structure
- **Act**: Execute with intelligence preservation

### Session Crystallization  
- **Plan**: Wizard identifies patterns ready for extraction
- **Simulate**: Show proposed concept/context/command creation
- **HITL**: Human validation of crystallization strategy
- **Act**: Extract to permanent system components

## Intelligence Features

### Parallel Context Loading (10 Workers)
```javascript
// Session initialization loads:
await Promise.all([
  loadIdeasConcepts(),      // Scan ideas/ for concept portfolio
  loadCoreContexts(),       // Load core/contexts/ (75+ contexts)
  loadSessionHistory(),     // Analyze session timeline
  loadSynthDefinitions(),   // Activate rolling synths
  loadPromptPatterns(),     // Load breakthrough prompts
  scanWorkflowPatterns(),   // Identify workflow opportunities
  analyzeSystemState(),     // Current system intelligence
  loadWizardExperience(),   // Wizard guidance system
  assessAdvancementNeeds(), // Concept readiness analysis
  generateDashboard()       // Unified intelligence dashboard
]);
```

### Synth Performance Tracking
```yaml
synth_metrics:
  usage_count: 15           # Times activated this session
  success_rate: 95%         # Successful task completion
  breakthrough_moments: 3   # Major insights generated
  promotion_candidate: true # Ready for permanent status
  evolution_history: [...]  # How synth has changed
```

### Session Intelligence Core
Every session maintains:
- **Mission context** - what we're trying to achieve
- **Synth ecosystem** - active thinking modes
- **Timeline events** - significant moments and decisions
- **Pattern extraction** - learnings ready for crystallization
- **Next session prep** - intelligence for continuation

## Commands Integration

### /session Command Family
All session management with wizard HITL for complex operations:
- Simple operations: new, load, save, checkpoint, dashboard
- Wizard operations: split, merge, crystallize, cleanup, archive

### /idea Command Family  
Concept lifecycle management with wizard guidance:
- Dashboard intelligence for concept portfolio
- Wizard-guided formalization pipeline
- Plan/simulate/HITL/act for all workflow operations

## Examples

### Daily Development Pattern
```bash
# Morning: Load yesterday's intelligence
/session load

# Show unified dashboard  
/session show dashboard

# Work with concept evolution
/idea formalize {ready-concept}

# Evening: Checkpoint progress
/session checkpoint
```

### Weekly Crystallization
```bash
# Review session patterns
/session show dashboard

# Extract successful patterns (wizard guided)
/session crystallize

# Clean up completed work
/session cleanup
```

### Meta-Learning Cycle
1. **Session Work** - Intelligence emerges through usage
2. **Timeline Tracking** - Significant events captured automatically  
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Wizard identifies crystallization opportunities
4. **Extraction** - Successful patterns become permanent contexts
5. **System Evolution** - Enhanced intelligence for future sessions

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Don't automate workflow decisions** - Always use wizard HITL
❌ **Don't skip timeline tracking** - Events are learning opportunities  
❌ **Don't ignore crystallization** - Successful patterns should become permanent
❌ **Don't work without synth activation** - Rolling synths provide specialized intelligence

## Success Metrics

✅ **Intelligence accumulation** - System gets smarter through usage
✅ **Pattern crystallization** - Breakthrough insights become reusable
✅ **Session continuity** - Knowledge transfers between sessions seamlessly
✅ **Meta-learning** - System improves its own learning processes

**Sessions are not just work organization - they are intelligence evolution laboratories where AI systems learn to think better.**
