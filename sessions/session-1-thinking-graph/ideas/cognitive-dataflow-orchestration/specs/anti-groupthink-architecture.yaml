    benefits:
      - No real-time influence between agents
      - Pure independent reasoning
      - Authentic diverse perspectives
      - Prevents cascade effects
    
  opposition:
    description: "Systematic devil's advocate layers ensure critical examination"
    levels:
      - initial: "Independent research and analysis"
      - challenge: "Active opposition to initial findings"
      - synthesis: "CEO perspective integration"
      - validation: "Skeptical review of synthesis"
  
  parallelization:
    description: "True parallel execution prevents sequential bias"
    implementation:
      - Simultaneous agent spawning
      - No shared runtime state
      - File-based result collection
      - Timestamp-based ordering
