    session_agent:
      location: ".claude/commands/session.md"
      features:
        - "Embedded YAML routing logic"
        - "Session + concept unified dashboard"
        - "Wizard HITL for complex operations"
        - "Session ID auto-detection and tracking"
        - "FlowMind-style conditional logic"
    
    idea_agent:
      location: ".claude/commands/idea.md"  
      features:
        - "Concept lifecycle intelligence coordinator"
        - "Portfolio analysis with advancement recommendations"
        - "Concept structure templates embedded"
        - "Wizard formalization pipeline"

  claude_md_updates:
    debug_header_enhanced:
      - "Added SESSION: [SESSION_ID] as first item"
      - "Added mood tracking (energy, momentum, focus)"
      - "Maintained rolling synths status bar format"
    
    session_tracking:
      - "Session continuity patterns documented"
      - "Intelligence crystallization framework"
      - "Bi-directional communication flows"

architecture_patterns:
  commands_as_mini_agents:
    pattern: "Each command acts like specialized agent with embedded intelligence"
    structure: "Agent config + routing logic + embedded templates + wizard integration"
    inspiration: "dev.yaml endpoints + FlowMind conditionals + mood awareness"
  
  embedded_intelligence:
    dashboards: "Unified session + concept portfolio analysis embedded in commands"
    templates: "Concept vision and session structures embedded vs external files"
    routing: "YAML-based conditional logic for operation selection"

key_innovations:
  session_id_tracking: "Auto-generation with {YYYY-MM-DD}-{HHMM}-{semantic-slug} format"
  unified_dashboards: "Single dashboard shows session progress + concept portfolio"
  mood_aware_debug: "Debug output tracks user energy, momentum, focus states"
  wizard_hitl_integration: "Complex operations route through plan/simulate/approve/act"

next_actions:
  - "Test commands with /session show dashboard"
  - "Validate concept portfolio analysis with /idea"
  - "Create session checkpoint to test timeline tracking"
  - "Dogfood command system for further refinement"
