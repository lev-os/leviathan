# CRITICAL SESSION GAPS - 4% CONTEXT EMERGENCY

## Missing Intelligence

### 1. BMAD Embedded YAML System
- BMAD templates have YAML frontmatter + embedded tasks + agent definitions
- Our smartdown (.smart.md) only captured [[LLM:]] pattern
- Need full BMAD system analysis from workshop/intake/BMAD-METHOD/

### 2. Tool Calling Architecture  
- Discussed tool calling system for synth integration
- MCP tool generation from synths
- Workshop automation via tool calling
- NOT captured in session artifacts

### 3. Schema Package Incomplete
- @lev-os/schema supposed to define smartdown format
- Template intelligence specifications missing
- YAML + markdown hybrid schema undefined

### 4. Synth-Tool Integration
- Synths need MCP tool generation
- Workshop automation requires tool calling
- Core integration with agent system missing

## Recovery Instructions for Next AI

1. **Research BMAD patterns** in workshop/intake/BMAD-METHOD/
2. **Load all linked concepts** for full context
3. **Complete @lev-os/schema** with smartdown specification  
4. **Design synth â†’ MCP tool pipeline**
5. **Integrate with existing agent/src/ architecture**

## Emergency Preservation Complete
Session intelligence captured but INCOMPLETE due to context limits.
