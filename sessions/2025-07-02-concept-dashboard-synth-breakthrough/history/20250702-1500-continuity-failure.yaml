# CRITICAL SESSION CONTINUITY FAILURE
failure_analysis:
  problem: "AI lost mental model and breakthrough insights from previous session"
  symptoms:
    - "Started creating new specs instead of analyzing existing work"
    - "Didn't recognize concept lifecycle system we built"
    - "Lost understanding of sessions vs concepts distinction" 
    - "Forgot synth evolution breakthrough"
    - "Missed connection to schema validation purpose"
  
  context_window_waste: "~95% spent re-establishing context that should have been preserved"
  
# WHAT WE WERE ACTUALLY DOING
real_work_context:
  core_schema_mission: "Create constitutional framework to validate context system + concept lifecycle + synth system"
  
  schema_challenge:
    - "Three different YAML approaches found (original philosophy, agency production, dev reality)"
    - "Need to test and synthesize best approach"
    - "Agency contexts show rich YAML consciousness streaming works"
    - "Original schemas have good philosophy but don't match reality"
    - "Dev context uses metadata wrapper + agent_config structure"
  
  testing_approach_needed:
    - "Evaluate all three schema approaches against real contexts"
    - "Test validation systems with actual YAML files"
    - "Decide: migrate contexts to schemas OR update schemas to match reality"
    - "Build BDD specs for whatever approach we choose"

# BREAKTHROUGH SYSTEMS WE BUILT
existing_architecture:
  concept_lifecycle_system:
    purpose: "Track ideas from ideation → specification → implementation"
    location: "concepts/ directory with index.yaml"
    status: "Working, needs schema validation"
    
  rolling_synths:
    purpose: "2-liner thinking modes that evolve across sessions"
    examples: ["concept_lifecycle_analyst_synth", "wizard_spec_analyst_synth"]
    breakthrough: "Real-time synth evolution during sessions"
    
  session_architecture:
    purpose: "LLM mental state + context preservation"
    location: "tmp/session-id/ directories"
    status: "Working but continuity failed this session"
    
  ceo_orchestrator:
    purpose: "Confidence-based expansion/compression with dynamic synth creation"
    location: "Enhanced in CLAUDE.md system prompt"
    status: "Active, working in current session"

# TEMPLATES & ARTIFACTS CREATED (UNTESTED)

  note: "All created before understanding real system context"

# NEXT SESSION CRITICAL ACTIONS
immediate_priorities:
  1: "LOAD this session file + parent session readme.yaml FIRST"
  2: "Activate concept_lifecycle_analyst_synth to understand concept portfolio"
  3: "Test one schema approach against real contexts (start small)"
  4: "Don't create new stuff until you understand what exists"
  5: "Use human-in-the-loop validation before any major decisions"

# SESSION CONTINUITY IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED
rolling_memory_gaps:
  context_loading: "Need automated loading of session intelligence on startup"
  synth_persistence: "Synths created but not automatically reloaded"
  mental_model_restoration: "Breakthrough insights lost between sessions"
  work_context_preservation: "Mission/purpose needs clearer preservation"

# HUMAN FEEDBACK INTEGRATION
user_guidance:
  session_definition: "Sessions = LLM working memory + context + synths + breakthrough preservation"
  concept_definition: "Concepts = persistent ideas that move through lifecycle via sessions"  
  schema_mission: "Validate context system + concept management + synth architecture"
  approach_preference: "Test existing work before creating new work"
  collaboration_style: "Human-in-the-loop, step-by-step, no assumptions"

# DOGFOODING STATUS
system_validation:
  concept_management: "Working - we have 9 concepts tracked with lifecycle status"
  session_preservation: "Partial - files exist but mental model lost"
  synth_evolution: "Working - wizard_spec_analyst_synth evolved during session" 
  schema_validation: "NOT WORKING - no validation system built yet"
  
breakthrough_quote: "Never seen concept lifecycle dashboard in any dev shop - daily driver intelligence"

# CONTEXT RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS
next_ai_should:
  1: "Read this file + parent session readme.yaml + concepts/index.yaml"
  2: "Understand we're building schema validation for existing systems"
  3: "Don't hallucinate new solutions - test what exists"  
  4: "Use CEO orchestrator debug headers"
  5: "Activate rolling synths for specialized thinking"
  6: "Get human approval before any major architectural decisions"
