    - "Added file mask patterns for deterministic intelligence loading"

current_session_state:
  phase: "Implementation and refinement complete"
  synth_ecosystem: "5 synths active with proven performance"
  crystallization_readiness: "High - multiple patterns ready for extraction"
  file_mask_system: "Operational with 10-worker parallel loading"
  
breakthrough_status:
  session_intelligence_system: "Fully operational and dogfooded"
