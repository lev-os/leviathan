# Schema Analysis State - Where We Left Off

schema_discovery_status: "Found 3 different YAML approaches, need testing"

# THREE SCHEMA APPROACHES DISCOVERED
approaches_identified:
  original_philosophy:
    location: "~/digital/kingly/~/lev/agent/contexts/_schema/"
    strengths:
      - "Tool requirements not implementations"
      - "Multi-modal execution support" 
      - "Strong philosophical foundation"
      - "Constitutional base + extensions"
    reality_check: "Doesn't match actual context structures"
    
  agency_production:
    location: "~/digital/kingly/hub/agency/contexts/"
    strengths:
      - "Rich consciousness streaming patterns"
      - "Specialist coordination systems"
      - "Workflow orchestration" 
      - "Prompt file integration"
      - "Production-tested architecture"
    reality_check: "Completely different structure from base schemas"
    
  dev_context_reality:
    location: "/agent/contexts/agents/dev/context.yaml"
    strengths:
      - "Actually implemented and working"
      - "Rich endpoint system (10+ specializations)"
      - "Memory integration patterns"
      - "Dynamic behavior support"
    reality_check: "Uses metadata wrapper, doesn't match either schema approach"

# CRITICAL MISMATCH ANALYSIS
structural_conflicts:
  base_schema_expects:
    - "id: string (top-level)"
    - "type: string (top-level)"
    - "description: string (top-level)"
    - "version: string (top-level)"
    
  dev_context_actually_has:
    - "metadata: {type, id, version, description} (nested)"
    - "agent_config: {capabilities, endpoints} (not persona/toolkit)"
    
  agency_contexts_have:
    - "name: string (top-level)"
    - "cognitive_framework: {...}"
    - "specialists: [...] with prompt_file references"
    - "workflows: {...} with complex orchestration"

# TESTING STRATEGY NEEDED
validation_approach:
  1: "Pick one real context file as test case"
  2: "Try validating against each schema approach"
  3: "Document what breaks and what works"
  4: "Decide on migration vs schema update strategy"
  5: "Build actual validation system for chosen approach"

# SCHEMA VALIDATION SYSTEM STATUS
implementation_gaps:
  runtime_validation: "NOT IMPLEMENTED - only YAML schema definitions exist"
  loading_system: "NOT IMPLEMENTED - no schema loading/validation code"
  error_handling: "NOT IMPLEMENTED - no error messages or validation feedback"
  integration: "NOT IMPLEMENTED - schemas not connected to agent system"

# CORE SCHEMA MISSION CLARIFICATION
real_purpose:
  validate_context_system: "Ensure 300+ contexts in agent/contexts/ follow standards"
  validate_concept_lifecycle: "Ensure concept management system follows schema rules"
  validate_synth_architecture: "Ensure synth definitions are structurally valid"
  enable_legos_integration: "Provide validated inputs for @lev-os/legos assembly"

# NEXT SESSION ACTIONS
immediate_testing_plan:
  1: "Choose dev context as test case (most complete example)"
  2: "Try validating against original base.schema.yaml"
  3: "Document exact failure points"
  4: "Try creating updated schema that validates dev context"
  5: "Test updated schema against agency context examples"
  6: "Build minimal validation implementation"
  7: "Get human feedback on approach before proceeding"
