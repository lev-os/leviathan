# WORKFLOW DEFINITION
workflow_steps:
  step_1:
    name: "Understand existing schema approaches"
    status: "completed"
    completion_context: "Found 3 approaches: original philosophy, agency production, dev reality"
    key_findings:
      - "Original schemas have good philosophy but don't match contexts"
      - "Agency contexts use rich consciousness streaming patterns"  
      - "Dev context uses metadata wrapper + agent_config structure"

  step_2:
    name: "Discover schema-context mismatches"  
    status: "completed"
    completion_context: "Documented structural conflicts between schemas and actual contexts"
    key_findings:
      - "Base schema expects top-level id/type/description/version"
      - "Dev context nests these under metadata wrapper"
      - "Agency contexts use completely different structure"
      - "No runtime validation system exists"

    required_actions:
      - "Load dev context.yaml and base.schema.yaml"

    decision_criteria:
      - "Which approach requires least migration effort"

# CURRENT STEP DETAILED STATE
step_3_detailed:
  current_task: "Test dev context against base schema"
  
  files_needed:
    source_context: "/agent/contexts/agents/dev/context.yaml"
    target_schema: "~/digital/kingly/~/lev/agent/contexts/_schema/base.schema.yaml"
    comparison_schema: "~/digital/kingly/~/lev/agent/contexts/_schema/agent.schema.yaml"
    
  expected_failures:
    - "Metadata wrapper not recognized by base schema"
    - "agent_config vs persona/toolkit mismatch"  
    - "Missing constitutional fields at top level"
    - "Rich endpoint structure not defined in agent schema"
    
  testing_approach:
    1: "Load both files and compare structures"
    2: "Document specific field mismatches"
    3: "Identify what would need to change for validation"
    4: "Estimate migration effort for each approach"
    
  success_criteria:
    - "Complete list of validation failures documented"
    - "Clear understanding of required changes"
    - "Effort estimation for each schema approach"
    - "Recommendation ready for human decision"

# SYNTH CONTEXT FOR STEP 3
step_3_synth_context:
  wizard_spec_analyst_synth:
    current_focus: "Analyzing schema validation failures"
    five_fold_context:
      evolution: "Schemas evolved separately from contexts, creating mismatch"
      impact: "Validation system needed to ensure constitutional compliance"
      relationships: "Schemas must serve context system, legos, and concept management"
      essence: "Constitutional compliance without constraining rich patterns"
      paradigm: "Schema serves reality, not the other way around"
    
  next_wizard_action: "Apply five-fold analysis to validation failure patterns"

# HUMAN DECISION POINTS
pending_decisions:
  schema_approach_selection:
    decision_needed: "Which schema approach to pursue"
    options:
      - "Update contexts to match original schemas (high migration effort)"
      - "Update schemas to match context reality (preserves existing work)"
      - "Hybrid approach with constitutional base + rich extensions"
    criteria: ["Migration effort", "Pattern richness", "Philosophy alignment"]
