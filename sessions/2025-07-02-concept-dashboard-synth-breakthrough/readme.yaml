# SESSION MENTAL MODELS (CRITICAL RESTORATION)
mental_models:
  session_vs_concept_clarity: "Sessions = LLM working memory + context preservation, Concepts = persistent ideas moving through lifecycle"
  rolling_synths: "2-liner thinking modes that evolve and roll forward across context windows"
  schema_mission: "Build constitutional framework to validate context system + concept lifecycle + synth architecture"
  dogfooding_purpose: "We are testing our own concept management system by using it for this schema work"

# KEY BREAKTHROUGHS (PRESERVE INSIGHTS)
breakthroughs:
  concept_lifecycle_dashboard: "Revolutionary daily driver intelligence for tracking concept readiness"
  rolling_synth_evolution: "Real-time synth creation and evolution during sessions" 
  session_architecture: "LLM-first freestyle structure with minimal templates"
  schema_reality_gap: "Found 3 different YAML approaches, none match actual contexts"
  rolling_synths_status_bar: "Compact rolling synths status bar design to replace XML debug blocks"
  
# CORE MISSION CONTEXT
mission_statement: "Build schema validation system for Leviathan context ecosystem"

mission_context:
  why: "300+ contexts in agent/contexts/ need constitutional validation"
  what: "Runtime validation system that checks context YAML against schemas"
  how: "Test 3 schema approaches, choose best, implement validation, integrate with legos"
  blocking: "Three schema approaches found, none match reality - need testing and decision"

# HUMAN COLLABORATION STATE
collaboration_context:
  human_preference: "Step-by-step validation with approval before major decisions"
  human_feedback: "Don't create new systems until you understand what exists"
  current_need: "Human guidance on which schema approach to test first"
  decision_pending: "Schema approach selection (original vs agency vs dev-reality)"

# ARCHITECTURE UNDERSTANDING
system_context:
  leviathan_agent: "MCP server with adapters (CLI, MCP, etc.) - Claude Code calls CLI adapter"
  contexts: "300+ YAML files defining AI capabilities (agents, workflows, patterns, tools)"
  sessions: "Working memory preservation system we built last session"
  synths: "Dynamic thinking modes created during sessions"
  concepts: "Persistent idea tracking system (ideation → specification → implementation)"

# CRITICAL FILES TO UNDERSTAND
required_reading:
  schema_examples:
    - "~/digital/kingly/~/lev/agent/contexts/_schema/base.schema.yaml # Original philosophy"
    - "~/digital/kingly/hub/agency/contexts/agents/brand/context.yaml # Agency production"

# NEXT SESSION CRITICAL ACTIONS
next_session_instructions:
  1: "Load this readme.yaml + workflow-state.yaml FIRST"
  2: "Activate wizard_spec_analyst_synth with preserved context"
  3: "Continue from workflow step 3: schema-approach-testing"
  4: "Test dev context against base schema, document failures"
  5: "Get human approval before choosing schema approach"
  6: "DO NOT hallucinate new solutions - work with what exists"

# CONTEXT RESTORATION TARGET
confidence_restoration:
  target_confidence: 95%
  success_indicators:
    - "Understands three schema approaches discovered"
    - "Knows we're testing validation, not creating new schemas"
    - "Remembers concept lifecycle system context"
    - "Activates correct synths with proper context"
    - "Continues from correct workflow step"

# DOGFOODING STATUS
system_validation:
  concept_management: "✅ Working - 9 concepts tracked with lifecycle"
  session_preservation: "⚠️ Partial - files exist but mental model restoration failed"
  synth_evolution: "✅ Working - real-time synth creation validated"
  schema_validation: "❌ NOT WORKING - mission of current work"

session_continuity_lesson: "Session files exist but mental model restoration requires active synth loading with context"
