# Brave Search Analysis Hook Proposal

hook_configuration:
  trigger: "PostToolUse"
  condition: "tool matches 'mcp__brave-search__brave_web_search'"
  
  command: |
    #!/bin/bash
    # Analyze Brave search results and suggest storage location
    
    # Parse search query from tool invocation
    QUERY="$CLAUDE_TOOL_ARGS"
    TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
    
    # Determine storage location based on query content
    if [[ "$QUERY" =~ "framework|programming|LLM" ]]; then
      echo "üîç Research detected: Suggesting storage in drafts/llm-frameworks-$TIMESTAMP.md"
    elif [[ "$QUERY" =~ "architecture|pattern|design" ]]; then
      echo "üìê Architecture research: Suggesting storage in docs/research/architecture-$TIMESTAMP.md"
    else
      echo "üìù General research: Suggesting storage in tmp/research-$TIMESTAMP.md"
    fi
    
    # Extract key insights prompt
    echo "üí° Consider extracting: Key frameworks, comparison points, implementation patterns"

implementation_steps:
  1: "Run /hooks command in Claude Code"
  2: "Select PostToolUse trigger"
  3: "Add condition for brave_web_search tool"
  4: "Configure analysis command"
  5: "Test with sample searches"

benefits:
  - "Automatic research organization"
  - "Consistent storage patterns"
  - "Quick insight extraction reminders"
  - "Session-aware research tracking"
