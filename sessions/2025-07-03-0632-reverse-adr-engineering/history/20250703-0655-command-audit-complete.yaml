description: "Completed audit of /idea and /session commands, identified schema embedding issues"

audit_findings:
  core_issue: "Commands lack embedded schemas causing structural problems"
  specific_problems:
    - "LLM creates wrong directory structures"
    - "Inconsistent file naming (concept.yaml vs readme.yaml)"
    - "Missing required fields in YAML"
    - "Time wasted on trial-and-error"
    
solutions_created:
  schema_embedding: "Embedded complete YAML schemas in command prompts"
  standardization: "All files now use readme.yaml naming"
  validation_hints: "Added structure validation instructions"
  directory_guidance: "Clear rules about what directories to create"
  
improvements:
  - "Deterministic file creation"
  - "Consistent structure across sessions"
  - "Reduced hallucination of unnecessary files"
  - "Clear schema reference for LLM"

ceo_mode_activation:
  trigger: "Human requested CEO mode for debugging"
  response: "Successfully analyzed and debugged command issues"
  outcome: "Created improved command versions with embedded schemas"

next_actions:
  immediate: "Test improved commands in practice"
  strategic: "Update actual command files in .claude/commands/"
  validation: "Verify schema compliance in future uses"
