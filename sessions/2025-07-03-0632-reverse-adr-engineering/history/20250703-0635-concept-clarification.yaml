description: "Human clarified reverse ADR engineering purpose and use cases"

clarification_captured:
  core_purpose: "Scan code and create ADRs/specs from existing implementations"
  primary_uses:
    - "Code analysis for architectural understanding"
    - "Context priming for LLM comprehension"
    - "Research synthesis and documentation"
    
  target_scenarios:
    - "Code built NOT to spec needs formalization"
    - "Missing formal specs/idea linking"
    - "No documentation or needs update"
    - "Organic architectural patterns need codification"

workflow_understanding:
  process: "Code → Codified fractals → Iterate with human → Formalize → Save"
  multi_session: "Workflow steps preserved across sessions for complex analysis"
  
side_issue_noted:
  brave_search_enhancement: "Need to add analysis for where to save research"
  proposed_solution: "Add brave search to hooks for post-processing"

synth_performance:
  reverse_adr_engineer_synth:
    understanding: "enhanced"
    confidence: 95%
    ready_for: "architectural pattern extraction"

next_actions:
  immediate: "Begin analyzing existing code for architectural patterns"
  enhancement: "Add brave search analysis hook"
  validation: "Confirm approach with human before deep dive"
