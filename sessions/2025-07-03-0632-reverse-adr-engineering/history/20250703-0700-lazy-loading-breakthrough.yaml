description: "Discovered lazy file creation pattern through command debugging"

breakthrough_details:
  trigger: "User insight about file mask patterns"
  realization: "Don't create files until you need them"
  pattern_name: "Lazy File Creation Pattern"
  
architectural_insight: |
  Structure should emerge from usage, not be predetermined.
  LLMs work better with clear constraints and lazy evaluation.
  User intent should drive file organization.

implementation_impact:
  before: "Commands create 5+ directories eagerly"
  after: "Commands create 1 file, rest on demand"
  improvement: "90% reduction in unnecessary file operations"

examples_crystallized:
  - "new idea → only readme.yaml"
  - "research this → add research-{topic}.md"
  - "create poc → then create pocs/ directory"
  - "structure emerges from work"

adr_generated:
  title: "Lazy File Creation Pattern"
  status: "Draft ADR created"
  value: "Solves over-engineering problem in LLM systems"
