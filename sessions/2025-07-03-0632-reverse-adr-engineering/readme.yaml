# SESSION INTELLIGENCE CORE
mission_statement: "Build reverse ADR engineering capability to extract architectural decisions from existing code patterns"

mission_context:
  why: "Leviathan has organic architecture patterns that need documentation via ADRs"
  what: "Reverse engineering process to identify and document architectural decisions from code"
  how: "Analyze codebase patterns, extract decision points, generate proper ADR documentation"
  opportunity: "Transform implicit architectural knowledge into explicit decision records"

# SESSION GOALS
session_objectives:
  primary: "Extract 3-5 major architectural decisions into proper ADR format"
  secondary: "Establish repeatable reverse ADR engineering process"

  decision_points: "Which patterns to prioritize for reverse engineering"

next_session_instructions:
  1: "Load this session with reverse ADR engineering context"
  2: "Activate both synths with architectural analysis mindset"
  3: "Begin with existing ADR analysis to understand documentation patterns"
  4: "Scan codebase for implicit architectural decisions"
  5: "Generate ADR candidates with human validation"
