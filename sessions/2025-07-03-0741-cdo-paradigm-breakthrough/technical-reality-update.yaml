user_correction:
  insight: "langgraph can be made infinite/streaming w/ a simple for loop, mastra has loops"
  reality_check: "this is a concept really i know we can make it w/ existing tools"
  implementation_note: "especially since i could hand write this w/ javascript"
  
technical_capabilities_verified:
  langgraph_2025:
    infinite_loops: "Built-in while loops and continuous execution"
    streaming: "Native .stream() API"
    implementation: "Simple for/while loop with exit conditions"
    
  mastra_2025:
    loops: "While/until loops added in 2025 updates"
    streaming: "Built-in .stream() method for workflows"
    infinite_execution: "Nested workflows with continuous execution"
    
  javascript_native:
    trivial_implementation: "Basic while loop with async/await"
    streaming: "Node.js streams or generators"
