# Multiple Workstream Development Plan Using Existing Worktree Infrastructure

## Perfect Combination Discovered

**Existing Infrastructure:**
- **`plugins/@lev-os/cmd`** - Complete worktree management system already built
  - `worktree-manager.js` with create/remove/list/cleanup functionality
  - Commands: `kingly cmd worktree <action>` 
  - Constitutional AI validation and job system integration

**Infinite Agentic Loop Pattern:**
- **`/project:infinite`** command orchestrates multiple parallel agents
- **Wave-based generation** with progressive sophistication
- **Specification-driven coordination** across parallel workstreams
- **Context management** for optimal resource usage

## Multiple Workstream Strategy

### Phase 1: Create Worktrees for Each Active Specification

**Use existing worktree manager to create parallel development environments:**

```bash
# Create dedicated worktrees for each spec
kingly cmd worktree create jepa-learning feature/jepa-implementation
kingly cmd worktree create agent-completion feature/hex-architecture-completion  
kingly cmd worktree create media-forge feature/media-processing
kingly cmd worktree create alive-tools feature/dynamic-workflows
kingly cmd worktree create workshop-plugin feature/fractal-architecture
```

### Phase 2: Apply Infinite Agentic Loop Pattern to Specifications

**Adapt their `/project:infinite` command concept for our specifications:**

**Instead of UI component generation, coordinate specification implementation:**

1. **Specification Analysis**: Parse each `_*.md` file for implementation requirements
2. **Worktree Reconnaissance**: Analyze existing code to understand current state
3. **Parallel Sub-Agent Deployment**: Launch specialized agents in each worktree
4. **Wave-Based Implementation**: Progressive development cycles across workstreams
5. **Context Management**: Share learnings between workstreams

### Phase 3: Worktree Coordination Commands

**Create Leviathan version of infinite agentic loop:**

```bash
# Single workstream development
lev workstream develop jepa-learning

# Parallel batch (3 workstreams)
lev workstream batch agent-completion media-forge workshop-plugin

# Full parallel development (all 5 workstreams)
lev workstream infinite

# Coordination and sync
lev workstream status
lev workstream sync
```

### Phase 4: Implementation Strategy

**Leverage existing infrastructure:**

1. **Use `worktree-manager.js`** for parallel environment creation
2. **Extend with coordination logic** similar to infinite agentic loop
3. **Apply to our specifications** instead of UI components
4. **Session management** across worktrees using existing session system
5. **Constitutional validation** using existing framework

## Key Advantages

**We already have the foundation:**
- Git worktree management ✅
- Process management ✅  
- Job system integration ✅
- Constitutional validation ✅

**Infinite agentic loop provides the coordination pattern:**
- Parallel agent orchestration
- Progressive wave development
- Context optimization across agents
- Specification-driven coordination

## Expected Outcomes

**All 5 active specifications developed in parallel:**
- `lev/_jepa.md` - JEPA 2 plugin implementation
- `agent/_2do.md` - Hex architecture completion
- `_mediaforge.md` - Media processing integration
- `_itsalivetools.md` - Dynamic workflow system
- `_workshop.md` - Fractal workshop plugin

**Revolutionary development velocity:**
- 16-week JEPA timeline becomes overall timeline
- Other workstreams complete faster and integrate
- Continuous cross-pollination of learnings
- Coordinated system evolution

This combines the YouTube video's coordination pattern with our existing worktree infrastructure to enable true parallel specification development.
