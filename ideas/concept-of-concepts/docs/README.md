# 🍄🧙🏽‍♂️ The Concept of Concepts

**The Universal Concept Lifecycle System - Project Management Revolution**

## Overview

The Concept of Concepts represents a breakthrough in how we think about project management, knowledge management, and creative work in an LLM-first world. Instead of rigid stages and tool lock-in, concepts flow naturally through stages driven by workshop engines and guided by wizard intelligence.

## The Core Insight

**Everything is a concept** - ideas, features, projects, architectures, problems, solutions. Each concept has a natural lifecycle and deserves first-class tracking and support.

## Why This Matters

Traditional project management assumes:
- Linear stages (waterfall thinking)
- Human-managed transitions
- Tool-specific workflows
- Rigid categorization

**LLM-first reality demands**:
- Fluid, iterative progression
- AI-driven advancement
- Natural stage evolution
- Context-aware decisions

## The Architecture

```
concepts/{id}/
├── docs/          # Human communication
├── research/      # Analysis and exploration  
├── code/          # Implementation artifacts
├── adr/           # Architectural decisions
├── bdd/           # Behavioral specifications
├── specs/         # Technical specifications
└── concept.yaml   # Lifecycle metadata (static)
```

## System Components

- **Workshop**: Engine that drives concepts forward
- **Wizard**: Intelligence layer for guidance and decisions
- **Context**: Foundational knowledge and patterns
- **Schema**: Structural definitions
- **Legos**: Assembly and building tools

## Revolutionary Implications

This isn't just better project management - it's **Project Management as Code** where:
- Concepts self-organize and evolve
- AI intelligence guides progression
- Knowledge accumulates and compounds
- Creative work becomes systematic

## Next Steps

See `research/` for detailed analysis and `specs/` for technical requirements.
