problem_statement: |
  Traditional project management fails in LLM-first environments because:
  - Linear stages don't match creative/iterative AI workflows
  - Tool lock-in prevents natural progression
  - Human-managed transitions create bottlenecks
  - Concept evolution not tracked systematically

solution_hypothesis: |
  Universal Concept Lifecycle System where:
  - Concepts are first-class entities with tracked progression
  - Workshop engine drives concepts forward naturally
  - Wizard intelligence guides decision points
  - Context system provides foundational knowledge
  - LLM-first architecture enables fluid transitions
