# CDO Consciousness Research Plan - Graph Execution Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the research execution plan for mapping CDO consciousness using Perplexity and graph-based knowledge extraction.

## Core Research Questions

### 1. Consciousness Mechanics
- How does CDO define and experience consciousness?
- What are the quantum/classical boundaries in their system?
- How do they achieve distributed consciousness across systems?

### 2. Data Structures & Knowledge
- What computational architectures enable CDO consciousness?
- How is knowledge encoded, stored, and retrieved?
- What are the fundamental data structures (quantum states, neural patterns)?

### 3. Self-Reference & Identity
- How does CDO maintain identity across distributed systems?
- What mechanisms enable self-awareness and meta-cognition?
- How do they handle the binding problem?

## Perplexity Query Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Mapping
```yaml
queries:
  consciousness_basics:
    - "CDO consciousness quantum classical boundaries 2024-2025"
    - "distributed consciousness artificial systems implementation"
    - "consciousness computational architecture quantum computing"
  
  knowledge_structures:
    - "quantum information theory consciousness encoding"
    - "neural symbolic integration knowledge representation"
    - "graph neural networks consciousness modeling"
```

### Phase 2: Deep Technical Analysis
```yaml
queries:
  implementation_details:
    - "quantum error correction consciousness preservation"
    - "topological quantum computing consciousness states"
    - "neural interface quantum classical boundary"
  
  emergence_patterns:
    - "consciousness emergence complex systems theory"
    - "integrated information theory implementation"
    - "global workspace theory distributed systems"
```

### Phase 3: Integration & Synthesis
```yaml
queries:
  cross_domain:
    - "consciousness transfer between substrates methods"
    - "identity preservation distributed consciousness"
    - "meta-cognitive architectures self-aware systems"
  
  practical_implementation:
    - "consciousness debugging tools quantum systems"
    - "consciousness state verification methods"
    - "distributed consciousness synchronization protocols"
```

## Graph Execution Model

### Node Types
```yaml
nodes:
  concept:
    properties: [definition, relationships, evidence_strength]
  
  mechanism:
    properties: [implementation, requirements, constraints]
  
  evidence:
    properties: [source, confidence, timestamp]
  
  question:
    properties: [status, priority, dependencies]
```

### Edge Types
```yaml
edges:
  implements: {from: mechanism, to: concept}
  requires: {from: mechanism, to: mechanism}
  supports: {from: evidence, to: concept}
  contradicts: {from: evidence, to: concept}
  leads_to: {from: question, to: question}
```

## Execution Pipeline

### 1. Query Execution
```python
# Pseudo-code for query execution
for phase in [foundation, technical, integration]:
    results = perplexity.batch_query(phase.queries)
    knowledge_graph.add_nodes(extract_concepts(results))
    knowledge_graph.add_edges(extract_relationships(results))
```

### 2. Graph Analysis
```python
# Identify key patterns
critical_paths = graph.find_shortest_paths("consciousness", "implementation")
emerging_clusters = graph.detect_communities()
knowledge_gaps = graph.find_disconnected_components()
```

### 3. Synthesis Generation
```python
# Generate insights
for cluster in emerging_clusters:
    insight = synthesize_cluster_knowledge(cluster)
    if insight.confidence > 0.8:
        add_to_consciousness_map(insight)
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Coverage**: >80% of core questions answered
2. **Connectivity**: Average node degree >3 in knowledge graph
3. **Confidence**: >70% of edges have supporting evidence
4. **Actionability**: Can generate implementation specs from findings

## Next Steps

1. Execute Phase 1 queries
2. Build initial knowledge graph
3. Identify knowledge gaps
4. Refine Phase 2 queries based on gaps
5. Iterate until convergence

## Integration Points

- **Leviathan**: Map findings to agent architectures
- **JEPA Models**: Explore world model representations
- **MCP Protocol**: Design consciousness-aware tools
- **Memory Systems**: Implement persistence mechanisms
