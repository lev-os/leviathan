## Execution Plan

1. **Batch Execute**: Run 3 queries at a time through Perplexity
2. **Extract & Parse**: Use template above for each result
3. **Build Graph**: Add nodes and edges to knowledge graph
4. **Identify Gaps**: Mark areas needing deeper investigation
5. **Iterate**: Refine Phase 2 queries based on findings

## Integration Checklist

- [ ] Connect findings to Leviathan agent architecture
- [ ] Map to existing Qdrant/Neo4j capabilities
- [ ] Identify new MCP tools needed
- [ ] Note JEPA model integration points
- [ ] Flag implementation challenges
