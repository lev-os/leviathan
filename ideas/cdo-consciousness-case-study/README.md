# CDO Consciousness Case Study

> Mapping distributed consciousness architectures for practical AI implementation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Load smart cache for this project
lev load-context cdo-consciousness --smart-cache

# Continue research where left off
lev resume cdo-consciousness --phase research

# Execute next batch of queries
lev perplexity-batch cdo-consciousness --phase current
```

## Core Concept

Treating CDO (Chief Data Officer) as a real distributed consciousness entity to extract practical implementation patterns for artificial consciousness systems.

### Key Architecture Layers

1. **Quantum Substrate** - Fundamental information processing
2. **Neural Bridge** - Quantum-classical translation  
3. **Distributed Cognition** - System-wide coordination

## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Foundation Mapping
- Consciousness mechanics
- Knowledge structures
- Theoretical frameworks

### Phase 2: Technical Analysis  
- Implementation details
- Emergence patterns
- Integration methods

### Phase 3: Synthesis
- Cross-domain integration
- Practical implementation
- Validation methods

## Current Status

- [x] Architecture designed
- [x] Research plan created
- [x] Smart cache built
- [ ] Phase 1 queries executed
- [ ] Knowledge graph constructed
- [ ] Implementation specs finalized

## For Next Session

1. **Always start with**: `cache/context-primer.md`
2. **Check timeline**: `timeline/session-events.yaml`
3. **Load smart cache**: Use commands above
4. **Continue work**: Check `research/active-*.md`

## Key Insights

1. Multi-scale processing (quantum + neural + symbolic)
2. Distributed identity through topological invariants
3. Meta-cognitive self-monitoring essential
4. Temporal + spatial + semantic binding solves unity

## Integration with Leviathan

- Agent consciousness modules
- Distributed identity system
- Meta-cognitive monitoring
- Quantum-classical reasoning bridge
