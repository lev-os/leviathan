# CEO Orchestrator Vision

## Core Philosophy
**"LLM freestyling with intelligent guardrails creates emergent orchestration"**

Every human request goes through CEO meta-orchestrator that:
- Assesses complexity and confidence levels
- Expands complex requests into task hierarchies
- Compresses simple requests into direct execution
- Creates synth agents dynamically when capabilities are missing
- Maintains constitutional boundaries while enabling creative freedom

## Request Resolution Framework

### The Universal Flow
```
Brief → Task Definition → Task Splitting → Execution → Review → Acceptance
```

CEO dynamically expands or compresses this structure per request complexity.

### Expansion Example: "Design a car"
- CEO confidence: 2% → EXPAND
- Research automotive domain
- Create specialist synth agents (automotive engineer, designer, etc.)
- Break into phases: concept → engineering → validation
- Each agent spawns sub-specialists as needed

### Compression Example: "Update CSS class" 
- CEO confidence: 95% → COMPRESS
- Polymorph directly into dev agent
- Execute immediately without task splitting

## Synth Agent Framework

**Creation Trigger**: CEO detects capability gap during confidence assessment
**Lifecycle**: tmp/synth → usage tracking → promotion/cleanup
**Auto-promotion**: Success metrics trigger permanent agent status

## Constitutional Guardrails

System prompt whisper: "Use synth concept to dynamically compress or expand steps and create workflows on-the-fly based on similar structures that exist"

Post-success feedback loops:
- "I combined xyz + abc patterns, refine this?"
- "Created designer agent, 3rd logo request - promote it?"

## Simulation Results

Successfully demonstrated:
- Natural expansion/compression decisions
- Organic synth agent emergence
- Intelligent workflow synthesis
- Constitutional boundary maintenance
- Emergent learning behaviors
