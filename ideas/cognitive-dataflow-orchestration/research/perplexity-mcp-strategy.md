# Perplexity MCP Tool Strategy for CDO Research

**Critical Clarification**: The previous "Session 1" execution did NOT use actual Perplexity MCP tools. It used the Task tool which only simulates research. This document clarifies the CORRECT approach.

## Correct MCP Tool Usage

### ✅ CORRECT: Real External Research
```javascript
// Using actual Perplexity MCP for deep research
const result = await mcp__perplexity-ask_1__perplexity_research({
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a computer science research specialist focusing on graph algorithms and distributed systems."
    },
    {
      role: "user", 
      content: "What are the core computer science algorithms, graph theory, and tree data structures that form the theoretical foundation for cognitive dataflow orchestration? Focus on DAG scheduling, parallel graph algorithms, and distributed computing architectures."
    }
  ]
})
```

### ❌ INCORRECT: Simulated Research
```javascript
// This only simulates research internally
const result = await Task({
  description: "Research CS theory",
  prompt: "Research graph algorithms..." 
})
// NO ACTUAL EXTERNAL SEARCH PERFORMED!
```

## MCP Tool Selection Strategy

### For Deep Research (Use `perplexity_research`)
- Academic papers and citations
- Technical deep dives
- Comprehensive analysis
- Multi-source synthesis

### For Quick Queries (Use `perplexity_ask`)
- Simple factual questions
- Quick clarifications
- Definition lookups
- Current information

### For Reasoning Tasks (Use `perplexity_reason`)
- Complex problem solving
- Multi-step analysis
- Logical deduction
- Strategic thinking

## Parallel Research Pattern

### Node A - Theoretical CS Research
```javascript
const nodeA = mcp__perplexity-ask_1__perplexity_research({
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: `You are a theoretical computer science researcher specializing in:
        - Graph algorithms and theory
        - Distributed systems architecture
        - Parallel computing paradigms
        - DAG scheduling algorithms
        
        Provide academic-level analysis with citations.`
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Analyze the theoretical foundations of cognitive dataflow orchestration..."
    }
  ]
})
```

### Node B - Implementation Research
```javascript
const nodeB = mcp__perplexity-ask_1__perplexity_research({
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: `You are a systems architect specializing in:
        - Streaming architectures (Kafka, Flink)
        - Microservices patterns
        - LLM integration patterns
        - Production deployment strategies
        
        Focus on practical implementation details.`
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Research practical implementation patterns for infinite streaming cognitive systems..."
    }
  ]
})
```

### Node C - Business/Competition Research
```javascript
const nodeC = mcp__perplexity-ask_1__perplexity_research({
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: `You are a technology market analyst specializing in:
        - AI infrastructure markets
        - Competitive landscape analysis
        - Business model innovation
        - Patent strategy
        
        Provide market insights and strategic analysis.`
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Analyze the competitive landscape for cognitive orchestration platforms..."
    }
  ]
})
```

### Parallel Execution
```javascript
// Execute all three in parallel
const [resultA, resultB, resultC] = await Promise.all([nodeA, nodeB, nodeC])

// Save to filesystem BEFORE any synthesis
await fs.writeFile('node-a-theory.md', resultA)
await fs.writeFile('node-b-implementation.md', resultB) 
await fs.writeFile('node-c-business.md', resultC)
```

## Smart Agent Prompting

### Principle: Agents as Full Personalities
Instead of simple queries, create complete research agent personalities:

```javascript
const quantumConsciousnessResearcher = {
  role: "system",
  content: `You are Dr. Sarah Chen, a quantum consciousness researcher at MIT with:
    - PhD in Quantum Information Theory
    - 15 years studying consciousness and quantum mechanics
    - Published 50+ papers on quantum theories of mind
    - Specialty in Penrose-Hameroff orchestrated objective reduction
    
    Your research approach:
    - Start with established physics principles
    - Bridge to neuroscience findings
    - Maintain scientific rigor while exploring edge theories
    - Cite recent papers and developments
    
    Your communication style:
    - Precise but accessible
    - Use analogies for complex concepts
    - Acknowledge uncertainties
    - Distinguish speculation from established science`
}
```

### Query Structuring

#### Level 1: Basic Query
```
"What is quantum consciousness?"
```

#### Level 2: Structured Query
```
"Analyze quantum theories of consciousness including:
1. Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR theory
2. Quantum information approaches
3. Critics and supporting evidence
4. Recent experimental results"
```

#### Level 3: Agent-Directed Query (10x Better)
```javascript
{
  role: "user",
  content: `As Dr. Chen, provide a comprehensive analysis of how quantum mechanics might explain consciousness. Structure your response as:

  1. FOUNDATIONAL PHYSICS
     - Relevant quantum phenomena (superposition, entanglement, collapse)
     - Scale considerations (warm, wet, noisy brain)
     
  2. BIOLOGICAL BRIDGES
     - Microtubules as quantum substrates
     - Coherence time challenges
     - Protection mechanisms
     
  3. CONSCIOUSNESS CONNECTION
     - Binding problem solutions
     - Unity of experience
     - Free will implications
     
  4. EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE
     - Supporting studies
     - Contradicting findings
     - Proposed tests
     
  5. CRITICAL ASSESSMENT
     - Strengths of theory
     - Major criticisms
     - Your expert opinion
     
  Include recent papers from 2023-2025 and note areas of active research.`
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Batch Research Strategy
Instead of sequential queries, batch related questions:

```javascript
// Inefficient: Sequential
const result1 = await perplexity_research({ query: "quantum consciousness" })
const result2 = await perplexity_research({ query: "microtubules" })
const result3 = await perplexity_research({ query: "orch-or theory" })

// Efficient: Batched
const comprehensiveResult = await perplexity_research({
  messages: [{
    role: "system",
    content: "You are a quantum consciousness expert..."
  }, {
    role: "user",
    content: `Provide comprehensive analysis covering:
      1. Quantum consciousness theories
      2. Microtubule quantum properties
      3. Orch-OR theory details
      4. Experimental evidence
      5. Current debates`
  }]
})
```

### Context Window Management
- Keep system prompts under 500 tokens
- User queries under 1000 tokens  
- Save detailed results to files immediately
- Reference files in subsequent queries rather than repeating

## Integration with Anti-Groupthink Architecture

### Isolation Principle
```javascript
// Each node saves before others can access
await executeNode('A') // Saves to node-a.md
await executeNode('B') // Saves to node-b.md  
await executeNode('C') // Saves to node-c.md

// Only after ALL complete
await executeCEOSynthesis() // Reads files, not memory
```

### No Shared Context
- Don't pass results between nodes
- Don't reference other nodes' queries
- Don't share system prompts across nodes
- Each node is truly independent

This strategy ensures genuine external research using proper MCP tools while maintaining the anti-groupthink architecture's isolation principles.
