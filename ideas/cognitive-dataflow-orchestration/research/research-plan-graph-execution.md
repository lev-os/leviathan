## Execution Strategy

### Query Dependencies

Each query builds on previous results:

1. **Linear Dependencies**: Each phase requires completion of the previous phase
2. **Cross-References**: Later queries reference specific findings from earlier queries
3. **Synthesis Points**: Every 3rd query synthesizes previous findings

### Result Integration

```yaml
integration_pattern:
  collect:
    - Save each query result
    - Extract key concepts
    - Note surprising findings
    
  connect:
    - Map concepts between queries
    - Identify recurring themes
    - Build concept network
    
  synthesize:
    - Create unified framework
    - Identify gaps
    - Generate new questions
```

### Dynamic Adaptation

The query plan adapts based on findings:

1. **Pivot Triggers**
   - Unexpected breakthrough in a specific area
   - Dead end in planned direction
   - New paper/development discovered

2. **Depth Adjustments**
   - Promising areas get follow-up queries
   - Well-covered areas get summarized
   - Novel areas get exploratory queries

3. **Cross-Domain Bridges**
   - When connections appear between domains
   - Create bridging queries
   - Explore unexpected relationships

## Query Templates

## Perplexity Optimization

### Query Crafting
1. **Specificity**: Include years, researcher names, specific theories

3. **Connections**: Ask for relationships between concepts
4. **Practicality**: Always include "implementation" or "practical"

### Result Processing
1. **Fact Extraction**: Pull specific claims and citations
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Look for recurring themes
3. **Gap Analysis**: Note what's not mentioned
4. **Follow-up Generation**: Create next queries based on gaps

### Efficiency Tips
1. **Batch Related Queries**: Group similar topics
2. **Use Pro Mode**: For technical depth
3. **Save Threads**: Build on previous conversations
4. **Cross-Reference**: Verify key claims across queries

## Conclusion

This graph-based research plan transforms the exploration of CDO from random searching to systematic knowledge building. Each query builds on previous findings, creating a comprehensive understanding that bridges consciousness theory, technical implementation, and philosophical implications.

The key is maintaining the graph structure - every new piece of information connects to existing knowledge, strengthening the overall framework and revealing new research directions.
