description: "Revolutionary paradigm combining dataflow programming, actor model, and DAG scheduling to enable infinite streaming cognitive graphs, parallel LLM reasoning networks, and dynamic topology adaptation - the first true cognitive programming language"

problem_statement: |
  Current LLM systems are fundamentally sequential with fixed execution topologies. While FlowMind 
  pioneered bidirectional orchestration and context switching, we discovered something bigger:
  TRUE COGNITIVE DATAFLOW PROGRAMMING. Multiple execution modes (infinite streaming, iterative 
  synthesis, pipeline cascades) operating simultaneously with dynamic graph reconfiguration.
  We need infinite operational modes for cognitive computing architectures.

solution_vision: |
  Cognitive Dataflow Orchestration creates the first cognitive programming language where:
  - Column A runs infinitely, constantly reporting results in real-time loops
  - Queued inputs feed into other cognitive pipelines as they become available  
  - A-D can run lock-step iterations with meta-synthesis between cycles
  - Sophisticated graph plans adapt topology based on cognitive load and performance
  - Dynamic reconfiguration enables infinite operational modes for any problem complexity
  This is the "Linux of AI Reasoning" - foundational cognitive infrastructure.

key_innovations:
  - "Infinite Streaming Nodes: Column A runs continuously, emitting to dependent columns in real-time"
  - "Lock-Step Synthesis: A-D parallel execution → meta-synthesis → enhanced iteration cycles"
  - "Dynamic Graph Topology: Self-modifying cognitive architectures based on performance metrics"
  - "Multi-Modal Execution: Stream + Batch + Feedback loops operating simultaneously"
  - "Cognitive Memory Architecture: Working memory, shared memory, and meta-memory patterns"
  - "CognitiveFlow Language: Formal specification for cognitive dataflow programming"

notes: |
  This breakthrough emerged from FlowMind's bidirectional orchestration discovery combined with 
  the realization that cognitive graphs can operate in infinite modes. The key insight: 
  "Column A can run infinitely constantly reporting results in loops, taking inputs from other 
  columns as they become available." This unlocks true cognitive dataflow programming.
  
  Patent strategy: 5 core claims covering cognitive dataflow language, dynamic topology adaptation,
  infinite streaming architecture, memory patterns, and multi-modal execution integration.
  This positions CDO as foundational IP for the distributed intelligence era.
