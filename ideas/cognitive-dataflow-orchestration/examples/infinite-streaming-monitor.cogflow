# This creates a continuous security monitoring system where:
# - security_analyst runs infinitely, processing streams in real-time
# - alert_processor reacts to insights as they arrive
# - incident_response activates in parallel when critical alerts detected
# - threat_intelligence adapts the entire system based on performance

# Usage:
# $ cogflow run infinite-streaming-monitor.cogflow
# > Starting infinite streaming cognitive security monitor...
# > security_analyst: Processing 1,247 events/sec
# > alert_processor: 3 warnings, 0 critical alerts in last hour
# > threat_intelligence: Added specialized_phishing_analyzer due to pattern spike
# > System running in adaptive mode with 4 active cognitive nodes
