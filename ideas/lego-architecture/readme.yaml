lifecycle:
  current_stage: "specification"
  progression:
    - stage: "ideation"
      notes: "Template confusion led to schema architecture clarity"
    - stage: "analysis"
      notes: "Five-fold path revealed two schema systems"
    - stage: "conceptualization" 
      notes: "Perfect lego factory vs builder metaphor alignment"
    - stage: "specification"
      notes: "ADR-013 created, package boundaries locked"
      
breakthrough_insights:
  core_metaphor: "Schema Factory (defines molds) vs Lego Builder (assembles pieces)"
  package_architecture:
    - "@lev-os/schema: Pure YAML schemas + intelligent .md templates"
    - "@lev-os/legos: Assembly, generation, task orchestration"
    - "@lev-os/context: Actual contexts (singular)"
    - "@lev-os/workshop: Meta-system for building the system"
    
  separation_clarity: "core/schema defines what CAN exist, core/legos defines how to USE what exists"
  
key_decisions:
  - "Templates ARE molds (content molds vs structural molds)"
  - "BMAD-inspired intelligent templates with [[LLM:]] instructions"
  - "Keep lego naming (not assembler/weaver/builder alternatives)"
  - "Workshop as meta-development system"
  
next_transitions:
  to_implementation:
    requirements:
      - "Package workspace entries"
      - "Schema migration from broken path"
      - "Template system with BMAD patterns"
      - "Workshop productionalization"
